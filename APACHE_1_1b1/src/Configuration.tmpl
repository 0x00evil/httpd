# Config file for the Apache httpd.

# Configuration.tmpl is the template for Configuration. Configuration should
# be edited to select system type. Configuration.tmpl should only be changed
# when a new system or module is added, or an existing one modified.

# There are three types of lines here:

# '#' comments, distinguished by having a '#' as the first non-blank character
#
# Lines which set a Make option --- these are simply copied into the Makefile
#
# Module selection lines, distinguished by having 'Module' at the front.
# These list the configured modules, in priority order (highest priority
# first).  They're down at the bottom.

# First, ordinary compile-time configuration.

# What to call the compiler:  For normal machines with ANSI compilers
# CC= cc
# For Suns or other non-ANSI platforms. Please make sure your gcc is
# 2.0 or later, as 1.40 seems to create bad code for the Sun 4.
CC= gcc

# CFLAGS, compile flags.

# -DMINIMAL_DNS is now obsolete. Use httpd.conf settings of
# HostnameLookups on
# or
# HostnameLookups off
#
# If you want to have more secure hostname resolution at the cost of some 
# performance, use -DMAXIMUM_DNS.
# If you want setting the xbit of a file to cause it to be treated as
# server-included HTML (unless it is a CGI script), say -DXBITHACK.  Note
# that this is a run-time option, per-directory, either way (via the XBITHACK
# command); this option only sets the default.

# If you find that your OS can't cope with mmap (compiles OKAY but refuses
# to run and moans "httpd: Could not mmap memory" .. or similar) try
# disabling use of shared memory for process management (scoreboard with
# -DNO_MMAP

# Status Instrumentation
#  In order for the status module to obtain full statistics Apache must
#  be modified to keep track of various information.  This is not
#  turned on by default.
# In order to enable full status details add -DSTATUS to
# the end of the CFLAGS line below

# [Some other former Apache compile-time options are now treated differently;
#  the virtual host code is always present; DBM auth is an optional module, and
#  may be configured out by changing the module config below, though it still
#  defaults in.  Note that this config file does not include DBM auth by
#  default --- configure it in below if you need it].

CFLAGS= -O2

# Module configuration
#
# Modules are listed in reverse priority order --- the ones that come
# later can override the behavior of those that come earlier.  This
# can have visible effects; for instance, if UserDir followed Alias,
# you couldn't alias out a particular user's home directory.

# Basic modules (i.e., generally useful stuff that works everyplace):

Module mime_module         mod_mime.o
Module access_module       mod_access.o
Module auth_module         mod_auth.o
Module negotiation_module  mod_negotiation.o
Module includes_module     mod_include.o
Module dir_module          mod_dir.o
Module cgi_module          mod_cgi.o
Module userdir_module      mod_userdir.o
Module alias_module        mod_alias.o
Module common_log_module   mod_log_common.o

# Modules which implement Apache extensions:
# These can be commented out if you don't want them

Module asis_module        mod_asis.o
Module imap_module        mod_imap.o
Module action_module      mod_actions.o
Module cern_meta_module   mod_cern_meta.o
Module env_module         mod_env.o
Module anon_auth_module   mod_auth_anon.o
Module digest_module      mod_digest.o

# The status module allows the server to display current details about 
# how well it is performing and what it is doing.  Consider also enabling 
# -DSTATUS (see the CFLAGS section near the start of the file) to allow
# full status information.  Check conf/access.conf on how to enable this.

Module status_module	mod_status.o

# Optional authentication modules, which should only be
# uncommented out if you have the neccessary system support.
# (if you don't have the decade-old "new" DBM libs, for example)

# Module dbm_auth_module  mod_auth_dbm.o
# Module db_auth_module   mod_auth_db.o
# Module msql_auth_module mod_auth_msql.o

# Optional modules for *full* NCSA compatibility --- we think these log
# files are a bad idea, but reasonable people seem to disagree:

# Module agent_log_module    mod_log_agent.o
# Module referer_log_module  mod_log_referer.o

# Finally, outright experiments --- mod_dld defines commands which
# allows other modules to be loaded in at runtime, and mod_cookies
# uses Netscape cookies to automatically construct and log accurate
# click-trails from Netscape cookies, for Netscape-using clients who
# aren't coming in via proxy.   

# Module dld_module     mod_dld.o
# Module cookies_module mod_cookies.o

# Even more finally, the proxy module. Incomplete, buggy and possibly dangerous
# Use it at your own risk.

# Module proxy_module       mod_proxy.o

# Finally, this is a *replacement* for mod_log_common which 
# supports a LogFormat directive which allows you to specify what
# goes into the TransferLog (if you want Referer, etc.) --- see the
# source code for docs.  It is likely that something like this will
# be the default logger in a future release, but this is very much
# an experimental piece of code, and the syntax, etc., are still
# up for grabs.
#
# If you play with this, remember to drop the standard
# mod_log_common --- a server with both will work, but you'll get
# very confused trying to figure out what's going on...

# Module config_log_module mod_log_config.o
