 Apache 1.3 Beta 7 Released
 ==========================

 The Apache Group is pleased to announce the release of the 1.3b7 version
 of Apache, the latest beta release of the Apache HTTP server.  1.3b7 is
 a second release candidate for Apache 1.3.0.
 
 This version is stable under UNIX but remains beta-level under Win32.  No
 new features are expected between 1.3b7 and 1.3.0, so please give this
 version a good thrashing in order to provide as much feedback as possible
 to the Apache Group before the release of 1.3.0.

 Apache has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April of
 1996.  The Web Server Survey by Netcraft (http://www.netcraft.co.uk/Survey/)
 found that more web servers were using Apache than any other software.
 Apache and its derivatives are run on over 50% of all web domains on the
 Internet.

 The Apache project has been organized to provide an open-source, secure,
 efficient and extensible server which provides HTTP services in sync with the
 current HTTP standards.  For more information about the Apache project check
