 Apache 1.3 Beta 7 Released
 ==========================

 The Apache Group is pleased to announce the release of the 1.3b7 version
 of Apache, the latest beta release of the Apache HTTP server.  1.3b7 is
 a second release candidate for Apache 1.3.0.
 
 This version is stable under UNIX but remains beta-level under Win32.  No
 new features are expected between 1.3b7 and 1.3.0, so please give this
 version a good thrashing in order to provide as much feedback as possible
 to the Apache Group before the release of 1.3.0.

 To grab the latest Apache distribution, check out
     http://www.apache.org/dist/
 and the huge list of available "International Mirror Sites" at
     http://www.apache.org/mirrors/

 For a full list of specific code changes see src/CHANGES.

 For an overview of new features in 1.2 please read the CHANGES file 
 in the distribution and the "New Features with Apache 1.3" document at
     http://www.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_3.html

 Major changes with this beta:
  HTTP: fixes for 400 and 408 error codes.
  WIN32: Child process spawning now uses native Win32 API.
	   This should address many problems people have had
           on Win32 - it also forced us to modify the 
           related child_spawn calls in the Apache API.
         Other various stability fixes.
         Extensive overhaul of the way UNCs are handled.
  Various mod_rewrite fixes.
  Various makefile cleanups.
  Various APACI changes.
  Various DSO cleanups, better support for AIX, OpenBSD, NetBSD
  Server's OS family now reported in Server: strings.
  PORT: added support for NCR MP/RAS 3.0
  Security: we now make sure all config files opened by Apache are not
            special devices.
  Added "-s" command line option to dump out vhost settings.
