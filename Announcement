                            Apache 1.3.15 Released
                                       
   The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache Server Project are
   pleased to announce the release of version 1.3.15 of the Apache HTTP
   server.
   
   This version of Apache is primarily a bug fix release, addressing
   some broken functionality present in the 1.3.14 release and
   various Win32 issues. There are, however, a few new features and
   improvements. A summary of the new features is given at the end of
   this document.
   
   We consider Apache 1.3.15 to be the best version of Apache available
   and we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of
   the 1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible. No further
   releases will be made in the 1.2.x family.
   
   Apache 1.3.15 is available for download from
   
     http://httpd.apache.org/dist/
     
   Please see the CHANGES_1.3 file in the same directory for a full list
   of changes.
   
   Binary distributions are available from
   
     http://httpd.apache.org/dist/binaries/
     
   As of Apache 1.3.12 binary distributions contain all standard Apache
   modules as shared objects (if supported by the platform) and include
   full source code. Installation is easily done by executing the
   included install script. See the README.bindist and INSTALL.bindist
   files for a complete explanation. Please note that the binary
   distributions are only provided for your convenience and current
   distributions for specific platforms are not always available.
   
   The source and binary distributions are also available via any of the
   mirrors listed at
   
     http://www.apache.org/mirrors/
     
   For an overview of new features in 1.3 please see

   In general, Apache 1.3 offers several substantial improvements over
   version 1.2, including better performance, reliability and a wider
   range of supported platforms, including Windows 95/98 and NT (which
   fall under the "Win32" label).
   
   Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over half
   of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of its
   variants.
   
   IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WIN32 USERS: Over the years, many users have come
   to trust Apache as a secure and stable server. It must be realized
   that the current Win32 code has not yet reached the levels of the Unix
   version, but is of acceptable quality. Any Win32 stability or security
   problems do not impact, in any way, Apache on other platforms.
   
                          Apache 1.3.15 Major changes
                                       
   The bug fixes are:
     * Correct handling of request byte ranges as specified by RFC 2616.
     * Restore functionality broken by the mod_rewrite security fix:
       rewrite map lookup keys and default values are now expanded
       so that the lookup can depend on the requested URI etc.
     * PHP now works under Unixware 7.
     * Eliminate caching problems of mod_autoindex results.
     * Win32 CGI execution on all Windows platforms is corrected.
       
   The main new features include:
     * Add a new LogFormat directive, %c.
     * mod_status now respects ?refresh=n of 1 or greater.
     * mod_autoindex fixes browser caching by sending LastModified
       and ETag headers if IndexOptions TrackModified is enabled.

   Selected new features that relate to Windows platforms:
     * Complete handling of ScriptInterpreterSource Registry execution.
     * NT and 2000 services can be started with -D FOO style options.
     * The close console window button/menu option on 95 and 98 works.
       
   Selected new features relating to other platforms:
     * Better discovery of dbm_open() under Linux.
     * Linux 2.2.x and later do not need a serialised single listener.
