 Apache 1.3.0 Released
 =====================

 The Apache Group is pleased to announce the release of the long
 awaited 1.3.0 version of the Apache HTTP server.  12 months, hundreds
 of patches and over 100 total code contributors helped make the
 release of 1.3.0 a reality.

 Apache 1.3.0 is the most stable version of Apache currently available;
 everyone running 1.2.X servers or earlier should upgrade to 1.3, as we
 will stop providing support for the 1.2.X tree, though we may make a
 release of 1.2.7. At present, the Win95/NT port of Apache is not
 as stable as the UNIX version. Further releases of the 1.3.x tree
 will bring the Win95/NT port closer to parity.

 In general, Apache 1.3.0 offers several substantial improvements
 over previous versions, including better performance, reliability
 and a wider-range of supported platforms, including Windows95 and
 NT.

 Apache is the most popular web-server in the known universe; over
 half of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of its
 variants.
