Apache 1.3beta5 Released
------------------------

The Apache Group is pleased to announce the release of the 1.3b5 version
of Apache, the latest beta release of the Apache web server.

Apache 1.3 offers numerous enhancements, improvements and performance
boosts over the 1.2 code base. The most visible and noteworthy addition
is the ability to run Apache under Windows 95 and NT (known as the
``Win32'' port). 

Apache 1.3b5 under both Win32 and UNIX has undergone extensive testing,
and is much improved over the previous 1.3b2 release. In particular, the
1.3b2 release for Win32 was considered a ``developer's version.''  We feel
confident that the Win32 port is ready for a wider audience, and with that
in mind, we are providing pre-compiled executables for the Win32 platform,
as well as a true Win32 environment Installer (InstallShield). This is,
however, still a beta release and there are known issues that will be
fixed before the final 1.3 release.

Please be sure to read the CHANGES file and the "New Features with Apache
1.3" document (at http://www.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_3.html).
This is particularly important if you are using non-IP based virtual hosts.

Apache has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April
of 1996. The September 1997 WWW server site survey by Netcraft (see:
http://www.netcraft.co.uk/Survey/) found that more web servers were
using Apache than any other software. Apache and its derivatives are run
on over 50% of all web domains on the Internet.

The Apache project has been organized in an attempt to answer some of
the concerns regarding active development of a public domain HTTP server
for UNIX. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and
extensible server which provides HTTP services in sync with the current
HTTP standards.
