Apache 1.3.9 Released
=====================

The Apache Group is pleased to announce the release of version
1.3.9 of the Apache HTTP server.

This new Apache version incorporates over 130 significant improvements
to the server.  Apart from portability and security fixes, documentation
enhancements, performance improvements, and assorted other minor
features or fixes notable changes are:

 - A new experimental digest authentication module, compatible with
   the latest digest-auth standards, has been added to the base package.  

 - The expat XML parser has been added to allow modules to deal with
   XML if necessary.

 - The processing on Windows of basic authentication passwords in
   mod_auth password files has been fixed.  In addition, the SHA1
   encoding algorithm has been added to those available and
   known to htpasswd, and passwords on Windows may be longer than
   the inadvertent 1.3.6 limit of 8 characters.

 - Several problems with mod_access and CIDR addresses have been fixed.

 - Support has been added or enhanced for Tandem, TPF, and
   the Macintosh OS X platforms.

 - Some processing of Vary response header fields has been corrected.

 - Restarts with "apache -k" on Windows are now honoured immediately,
   instead of after the system's listen queue is drained.

 - "Expect: 100-continue" processing has been corrected.

 - Script errors on Windows are now copied to the server's error log
   if the scripts fail; this is closer to the Unix behaviour.

 - Mass-vhosting has been added (see the documentation for module
   mod_vhost_alias).

 - The server no longer automatically checks for the existence of a
   valid DocumentRoot for all virtual hosts; this was imposing a
   significant startup penalty on systems with numerous vhosts.
   The default behaviour has changed to *not* performing this
   check, but it can be re-enabled by specifying the "-t" command
   line option for full configuration testing.

 - "apache -S" on Windows now exits properly after completing the
   configuration testing.

 - SetEnvIf* directives can now test the values of environment
   variables as well as request attributes.  In addition,
   the request protocol and level (e.g., "HTTP/1.1") can now be tested.

 - ReadmeName and HeaderName files (mod_autoindex) are now
   server-parsable and accessible with MultiViews.

 - AddDescription directives now behave as documented with regard
   to partial filename matches.

 - The name of the cookie used by mod_usertrack is now customisable.

A complete listing with detailed descriptions is provided in the
src/CHANGES file.

We consider Apache 1.3.9 to be the best version of Apache available and
we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of the
1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible.  No further releases
will be made in the 1.2.x family.


Apache 1.3.9 is available for download from

    http://www.apache.org/dist/

Please see the CHANGES_1.3 file in the same directory for a full
list of changes.

Binary distributions are available from

   http://www.apache.org/dist/binaries/

As of Apache 1.3.9 binary distributions contain all standard Apache
modules as shared objects (if supported by the platform) and include
full source code.  Installation is easily done by executing the
included install script.  See the README.bindist and INSTALL.bindist
files for a complete explanation.  Please note that the binary
distributions are only provided for your convenience and current
distributions for specific platforms are not always available.

The source and binary distributions are also available via any of the
mirrors listed at

    http://www.apache.org/mirrors/

For an overview of new features in 1.3 please see

    http://www.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_3.html

In general, Apache 1.3 offers several substantial improvements
over version 1.2, including better performance, reliability and a
wider range of supported platforms, including Windows 95/98 and NT
(which fall under the "Win32" label).

Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over
half of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of
its variants.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WIN32 USERS: Over the years, many users have
come to trust Apache as a secure and stable server.  It must
be realized that the current Win32 code has not yet reached these
levels and should still be considered to be of beta quality.  Any
Win32 stability or security problems do not impact, in any way,
Apache on other platforms.  With the continued donation of time
and resources by individuals and companies, we hope that the Win32
version of Apache will grow stronger through the 1.3.x release cycle.


Thank you for using Apache.
