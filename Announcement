ROUGH DRAFT COPY
Apache 1.3beta3 Released
------------------------

The Apache Group is pleased to announce the release of the second public
beta release of Apache 1.3. 

Apache 1.3 offers numerous enhancements, improvements and performance
boosts over the 1.2 codebase. The most visible and noteworthy addition
is the ability to run Apache under Windows 95 and NT (known as the
``Win32'' port). 

Apache 1.3b3 under both Win32 and UNIX has undergone extensive testing,
and is much improved over the previous 1.3b2 release. In particular,
the 1.3b2 release for Win32 was considered a ``developers version.''
We feel pretty confident that the Win32 port is ready for a much wider
audience, and with that in mind, we are providing pre-compiled
executables for the Win32 platform.

Apache has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April
of 1996. The September 1997 WWW server site survey by Netcraft (see:
http://www.netcraft.co.uk/Survey/) found that more web servers were
using Apache than any other software. Apache and its derivatives are run
on over 48% of all web domains on the Internet.

The Apache project has been organized in an attempt to answer some of
the concerns regarding active development of a public domain HTTP server
for UNIX. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and
extensible server which provides HTTP services in sync with the current
HTTP standards.
