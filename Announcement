 Apache 1.3 Beta 6 Released
 ==========================

 The Apache Group is pleased to announce the release of the 1.3b6 version
 of Apache, the latest beta release of the Apache HTTP server. 1.3b6 is
 a release candidate for Apache 1.3.0; This version is stable under UNIX
 but remains beta-level under Win32. No new features are expected between
 1.3b6 and 1.3.0, so please give this version a good thrashing in order
 to provide as much feedback as possible to the Apache Group before the
 release of 1.3.0.

 Apache has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April of
 1996. The Web Server Survey by Netcraft (http://www.netcraft.co.uk/Survey/)
 found that more web servers were using Apache than any other software. Apache
 and its derivatives are run on over 50% of all web domains on the Internet.

 The Apache project has been organized in an attempt to answer some of the
 concerns regarding active development of a public domain HTTP server for
 Unix. The goal of this project is to provide an open-source, secure,
 efficient and extensible server which provides HTTP services in sync with the
 current HTTP standards. For more information about the Apache project check
 out http://www.apache.org/.
