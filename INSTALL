        http://www.apache.org/docs/windows.html, (or the
        htdocs/manual/windows.html file included with Apache). 
        The following applies only to Unix users.

  Introduction
  ============

  Like all good things, there are two ways to configure, compile, and install
  Apache.  You can go for the 3-minute installation process using the APACI
  process described below; or, you can opt for the same mechanism used in
  previous versions of Apache, as described in the file 'src/INSTALL'.  Each
  mechanism has its benefits and drawbacks - APACI is newer and a little more
  raw, but it gets you up and running the least amount of time, whereas the
  "Configuration.tmpl" mechanism may be more familiar and give you some more
  flexibility to the power user.  We'd be very interested in your comments and
  feedback regarding each approach.


  Installing the Apache 1.3 HTTP server with APACI
  ================================================

  1. Overview for the impatient
     --------------------------

     $ ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
     $ make
     $ make install
     $ PREFIX/sbin/apachectl start

  2. Requirements
     ------------

     The following requirements exist for building Apache:

     o  Disk Space: 

        Make sure you have approximately 12 MB of temporary free disk space
        available.  After installation Apache occupies approximately 3 MB of
        disk space (the actual required disk space depends on the amount of
        compiled in third party modules, etc).

     o  ANSI-C Compiler: 

        Make sure you have an ANSI-C compiler installed. The GNU C compiler
        (GCC) from the Free Software Foundation (FSF) is recommended (version
        2.7.2 is fine). If you don't have GCC then at least make sure your
        vendors compiler is ANSI compliant. You can find the homepage of GNU
        at http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/ and the GCC distribution under
        http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/order/ftp.html .

     o  Perl 5 Interpreter [OPTIONAL]:

        For some of the support scripts like `apxs' or `dbmmanage' (which are
        written in Perl) the Perl 5 interpreter is required (versions 5.003
        and 5.004 are fine). If no such interpreter is found by APACI's
        `configure' script this is no harm.  Of course, you still can build
        and install Apache 1.3. Only those support scripts cannot be used. If
        you have multiple Perl interpreters installed (perhaps a Perl 4 from
        the vendor and a Perl 5 from your own), then it is recommended to use
        the --with-perl option (see below) to make sure the correct one is
        selected by APACI.

     o  Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) support [OPTIONAL]:

        To provide maximum flexibility Apache now is able to load modules
        under runtime via the DSO mechanism by using the pragmatic
        dlopen()/dlsym() system calls. These system calls are not available
        under all operating systems therefore you cannot use the DSO mechanism
        on all platforms. And Apache currently has only limited built-in
        knowledge on how to compile shared objects because this is heavily
        platform-dependend. The current state is this:

        o Out-of-the-box supported platforms are:
           - Linux     - IRIX
           - FreeBSD   - HPUX
           - OpenBSD   - OSF1
           - NetBSD    - UnixWare
           - SunOS     - AIX
           - Solaris 

        o Entirely unsupported platforms are:
           - Ultrix

        If your system is not on these lists but has the dlopen-style
        interface, you either have to provide the appropriate compiler and
        linker flags (see CFLAGS_SHLIB, LDFLAGS_SHLIB and LDFLAGS_SHLIB_EXPORT
        below) manually or at least make sure a Perl 5 interpreter is
        installed from which Apache can guess the options.

        For more in-depth information about DSO support in Apache 1.3 please
        read the file src/README.DSO carefully. Especially the section
        entitled "Advantages & Disadvantages" because using the DSO mechanism
        can have strange side-effects if you are not carefully. BE WARNED!

  3. Configuring the source tree
     ---------------------------

     NOTE: Although we'll often advice you to read the src/Configuration.tmpl
           file parts to better understand the various options in this
           section, there is _AT NO TIME_ any need to _EDIT_ this file. The
           _COMPLETE_ configuration takes place via command line arguments and
           loal shell variables for the ./configure script. The
           src/Configuration.tmpl file is just a _READ-ONLY_ resource, here.

     Introduction:

     The next step is to configure the Apache source tree for your particular
     platform and personal requirements. The most important setup here is the
     location prefix where Apache is to be installed later, because Apache has
     to be configured for this location to work correctly. But there are a lot
     of other options available for your pleasure.

     For a short impression of what possibilities you have, here is a typical
     example which compiles Apache for the installation tree /sw/pkg/apache
     with a particular compiler and flags plus the two additional modules
     mod_rewrite and mod_proxy for later loading through the DSO mechanism: 

     $ CC="pgcc" OPTIM="-O2" \
       ./configure --prefix=/sw/pkg/apache \
                   --enable-module=rewrite --enable-shared=rewrite \
                   --enable-module=proxy   --enable-shared=proxy

     The complete reference of all configuration possibilities follows. For
     more real-life configuration examples please check out the file
     README.configure.

                               [--datadir=DIR]        [--disable-shared=NAME] 
                               [--includedir=DIR]     
                               [--localstatedir=DIR]  [--enable-suexec]     
                               [--runtimedir=DIR]     [--suexec-caller=UID] 
                               [--logfiledir=DIR]     [--suexec-userdir=DIR]
                               [--proxycachedir=DIR] 
                               [--compat]             [--with-perl=FILE]   
                                                      [--without-support] 

     Use the CC, OPTIM, CFLAGS, INCLUDES, LDFLAGS, LIBS, CFLAGS_SHLIB,
     LDFLAGS_SHLIB, LDFLAGS_SHLIB_EXPORT and RANLIB environment variables to
     override the corresponding default entries in the src/Configuration.tmpl
     file (see there for more information about their usage).

         Note: The syntax ``KEY=VALUE ./configure ...'' (one single line!) is
               the GNU Autoconf compatible way of specifying defines and can
               be used with Bourne shell compatible shells only (sh, bash,
               ksh). If you use a different type of shell either use ``env
               KEY=VALUE ./configure ...'' when the `env' command is available
               on your system or use ``setenv KEY VALUE; ./configure ...'' if
               you use one of the C-shell variants (csh, tcsh).

         Note: The above parameter names are the canonical ones used in
               Autoconf-style interfaces. But because src/Configuration.tmpl
               uses the prefix EXTRA_ for some variables (e.g. EXTRA_CFLAGS)
               these variants are accepted for backward-compatibility reasons,
               too. But please use the canonical Autoconf-style names and
               don't rely on this.

     Use the --prefix=PREFIX and --exec-prefix=EPREFIX options to configure
     Apache to use a particular installation prefix. The default is
     PREFIX=/usr/local/apache and EPREFIX=PREFIX.

     Use the --bindir=DIR, --sbindir=DIR, --libexecdir=DIR, --mandir=DIR,
     --sysconfdir=DIR, --datadir=DIR, --includedir=DIR, --localstatedir=DIR,
     --runtimedir=DIR, --logfiledir=DIR and proxycachedir=DIR option to change
     the paths for particular subdirectories of the installation tree.
     Defaults are bindir=EPREFIX/bin, sbindir=EPREFIX/sbin,
     libexecdir=EPREFIX/libexec, mandir=PREFIX/man, sysconfdir=PREFIX/etc,
     datadir=PREFIX/share, includedir=PREFIX/include,
     localstatedir=PREFIX/var, runtimedir=PREFIX/var/run,
     logfiledir=PREFIX/var/log and proxycachedir=PREFIX/var/proxy.

     Use the --compat option to install Apache into a installation tree which
     has a similar layout than the one used with Apache 1.2.
 
     Use the --layout option to check the final installation path layout while
     fiddling with the options above.
 
     Use the --enable-rule=NAME and --disable-rule=NAME options to enable or
     disable a particular Rule from the Apache src/Configuration.tmpl file. The
     defaults (yes=enabled, no=disabled) can either be seen when running
     `./configure --help' or manually looked up in the src/Configuration.tmpl
     file.
 
     Use the --add-module=FILE option to copy a module source file to the
     Apache src/modules/extra/ directory and on-the-fly add an entry for it in
     the configuration file. FILE has to be a valid path to a C source file
     outside the Apache source tree, for instance /path/to/mod_foo.c. The added
     module this is way is automatically activated and enabled. Use this option
     to automatically include a simple third-party module to the Apache build
     process.
 
     Use the --activate-module=FILE option to on-the-fly add an entry for an
     existing module source file in the configuration file. FILE has to be a
     valid path under src/modules/ of the Apache source tree, i.e. it already
     has to be copied to this location before.  The module is automatically
     enabled. Use this option to automatically include a complex third-party
     module to the Apache build process where, for instance a module like
     mod_perl or mod_php3 consisting of more than one file which are created by
     a third-party configuration scheme.
 
     Use the --enable-module=NAME and --disable-module=NAME options to enable
     or disable a particular already distributed module from the Apache
     src/Configuration.tmpl file. The correct module names (no `mod_' prefix!)
     and defaults (yes=enabled, no=disabled) can be seen when running
     `./configure --help'.  There are two special NAME variants: "all" for
     enabling or disabling all modules and "most" for enabling or disabling
     only these modules which are useable on all platforms (currently this is
     "all" minus the modules auth_db, log_agent, log_referer, example, so and
     mmap_static).
 
     Use the --enable-shared=NAME and --disable-shared=NAME options to enable
     or disable the shared object support for a particular module from the
     Apache src/Configuration.tmpl file. The defaults (yes=enabled,
     no=disabled) can be seen when running `./configure --help'. There are two
     special NAME variants: "max" for enabling or disabling all modules except
     the bootstrapping "so" module and "remain" for enabling or disabling only
     these modules which are still not enabled. 
     
         Note 1: The --enable-shared option DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY enable the
                 module because there are variants like `--enable-shared=all'
                 which should not imply `--enable-module=all'.  

         Note 2: Per default the DSO mechanism is globally disabled, i.e. no
                 modules are build as shared objects.

         Note 3: The usage of any --enable-shared option automatically implies
                 a --enable-module=so option because the bootstrapping module
                 mod_so is always needed for DSO support.

         Note 4: When you later want to extend your Apache installation via
                 third-party modules through the DSO+APXS mechanism make sure
                 that you at least compile with mod_so included, even when no
                 distributed modules are build as shared objects. This can be
                 achieved by explicitly using --enable-module=so.

     Use the --with-perl=FILE option to select a particular Perl interpreter
     executable to be used with Apache. Per default APACI tries to find it
     automatically. But if multiple Perl instances exist on your system you
     have to select the correct one manually.
 
     Use the --without-support option to explicitly disable the build and
     installation of support tools from the src/support/ area. This can be
     useful when you have compilation problems with one or more of these not
     programs on your platform or if you just don't need them.
 
     Use the --enable-suexec option to enable the suEXEC feature by building
     and installing the "suexec" support program. Use --suexec-caller=UID to
     set the allowed caller user id and --suexec-userdir=DIR to set the user
     subdirectory for this feature.
     
     Use the --shadow option to let APACI create a shadow source tree of the
     sources for building. This is useful when you want to build for different
     platforms in parallel (usually through a NFS, AFS or DFS mounted
     filesystem).
 
     Use the --quiet option to disable all configuration verbose messages.
 
     Use the --verbose option to enable additional verbose messages.
     
  4. Building the package
     --------------------
     
     Now you can build the various parts which form the Apache package by
     simply running the command
 
        $ make 
 
     Please be patient here, this takes approximately 2 minutes to complete
     under a Pentium-166/FreeBSD-2.2 system, dependend on the amount of
     modules you have enabled. 
 
  5. Installing the package
     ----------------------
     
     Now its time to install the package under the configured installation
     PREFIX (see --prefix option above) by running:
 
        $ make install
 
     For the paranoid hackers under us: The above command really installs under
     prefix _only_, i.e. no other stuff from your system is touched. Even if
     you upgrade an existing installation your configuration files in
     PREFIX/etc/ are preserved.

     Note for package authors:

     To simplify rolling a package tarball from the installed files APACI
     provides a way to override the installation root for the install step.
     Additionally you can get rid of the user message at the end of the
     installation process by using the `install-quiet' target. Example:

         $ make install-quiet root=/tmp/apache-root
 
  6. Testing the package
     -------------------
 
     Now you can fire up your Apache HTTP server by immediately running
 
        $ PREFIX/sbin/apachectl start
 
     and then you should be able to request your first document via URL
     http://localhost/. Then stop the server again by running:
  
        $ PREFIX/sbin/apachectl stop
 
  7. Customizing the package
     -----------------------
 
     Finally you can customize your Apache HTTP server by editing the
     configuration files under PREFIX/etc/.
 
        $ vi PREFIX/etc/httpd.conf
        $ vi PREFIX/etc/access.conf
        $ vi PREFIX/etc/srm.conf
 
     Have a look at the Apache manual under http://localhost/manual/ or
     http://www.apache.org/docs/ for a complete reference of available
     configuration directives.
