CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
      that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
      made in the trunk.

    * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
      as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
      get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
      branches/2.2.x, as applicable.

PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:

    * mpm_winnt: Fix return values from wait_for_many_objects.
      Note - this is required to avoid hangups of socket #64, #128
      as Microsoft set aside 64 reserved values.
      Trunk version of patch:
        http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=428029
      2.2.x version of patch:
        Trunk version works
      +1: mturk, wrowe

    * Bundled PCRE: backport r381783 from trunk
      Fix brokenness on certain platforms when building with -DDEBUG.
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=381783
      +1 sctemme, fielding, pquerna, jerenkrantz
      -1 niq: Why are we hacking a third-party package as bundled,
              rather than upstream?  This has potential for chaos
              for modules (and we have a history of PCRE trouble)
              as well as a maintenance nightmare!
      jerenkrantz: I don't believe that's a valid reason to block this.
                   We're bundling PCRE for the duration of the 2.2.x series,
                   but we can re-evaluate for future major/minor revs.
      wrowe: nak niq, ack je; this is a silly debate, fix, push fixes upstream
             and adopt a newer PCRE at trunk/.

    * PKCS#7: backport PCKS#7 patches from trunk.
      +1 ben
      jerenkrantz: What's the revision number to backport?
      wrowe asks: ditto jerenkrantz

    * mod_deflate: Rework inflate output and deflate output filter to fix
      several issues: Incorrect handling of flush buckets, potential memory
      leaks, excessive memory usage in inflate output filter for large
      compressed content

      2.2.x version of patch:
        Trunk versions work. For convenience of review I merged the patches
        for the deflate output filter and the inflate output filter:
          Changes on deflate output filter:
            Patch: http://people.apache.org/~rpluem/patches/mod_deflate_rework/deflate_output.diff
            Merged subversion comments: http://people.apache.org/~rpluem/patches/mod_deflate_rework/deflate_output.log
          Changes on inflate output filter:
            Patch: http://people.apache.org/~rpluem/patches/mod_deflate_rework/inflate_output.diff
            Merged subversion comments: http://people.apache.org/~rpluem/patches/mod_deflate_rework/inflate_output.log
        The patch for the inflate output filter requires the patch for the
        deflate output filter.
        Alternately, substitute mod_deflate.c of trunk (at r483597) which maps
        to the same result as the net patches.

    * Allow htcacheclean and httxt2dbm to link apr/apr-util statically
      like the older support programs.
      Trunk version of patch:
        http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=441796
      2.2.x version of patch:
        http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox//httpd-dev/200609.mbox/%3c1404e5910609091218p84f4d2flc1000764b4966727@mail.gmail.com%3e

    * mod_proxy: Support variable interpolation in reverse proxy configuration
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=421686  (code)
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=422178  (code)
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/manual/mod/mod_proxy.xml?r1=420990&r2=421725 (docs)
      +1: niq, mturk
      -.9: wrowe notes; modifying the existing syntax seems inappropriate, new
           ProxyPassSubstitute or similarly named directives would seem to
           make more sense, permit direct Reverse'als when appropriate and
           restrict the Substitutions to be parsed only when required.

   * mod_authn_dbd: Export any additional columns queried in the SQL select
     into the environment with the name AUTHENTICATE_<COLUMN>. This brings
     mod_authn_dbd behaviour in line with mod_authnz_ldap.
     Trunk: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=466865
     +1: minfrin
     niq: This wants a little tidying.  Use of 13 as a magic number (for a
          strlen of something defined elsewhere) is nasty.  More importantly
          you need to document how it affects the module's directives.
          I'll +1 it when that's done.
     wrowe: ditto's - good concept.

   * core: Allow AcceptMutex to accept pathname arguments ala SSLMutex,
     and, as a result, semi-depreciate Lockfile.
     Trunk version of patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=467326
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=468049
     2.2.x version of patch:
       Trunk version works (requires handling of CHANGES and ap_mmn.h
       conflict though)
     +1: jim, wrowe
     wrowe notes: Adding to ease migration to 2.4 - good.  Deprecating 
                  any directive in a .even released branch, bad.
     jim notes: it's more an enhancement to AcceptMutex than a
                depreciation of LockFile... no regressions are
                introduced.
     wrowe adds: Isn't it time for SSL/FTP/JK/FTP who all need the very
                 same syntax to benefit from one generic implementation
                 (in httpd, not apr, since it's config syntax specific).

   * mod_proxy_balancer: Remove unnecessary lock/unlock for
     the post_request hook. We are actually doing nothing here.
     But keep the code (but macroed out) for future usage.
     Trunk version of patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=484789
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=484794
     2.2.x version of patch:
       Trunk version works.
     +1: jim
     +0: rpluem: Shouldn't we remove this code on 2.2.x? Keeping seems to be ok
         for me on trunk, but on a stable branch?
         jim says: the reason why we keep it is in case we
         ever start using it. So we keep the framework in
         that case. Make trunk backports easier.

   * mod_proxy: Log unlock errors (as we do with locking errors).
     Add additional clarification on where the error occurred.
     Trunk version of patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=484792
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=484787
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=484978
     2.2.x version of patch:
       For r484787, see: http://people.apache.org/~jim/patches/lock.txt
       otherwise, trunk version works.
