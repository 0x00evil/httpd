CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
      that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
      made in the trunk.

    * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
      as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
      get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
      branches/2.2.x, as applicable.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * Bundled PCRE: backport r381783 from trunk
      Fix brokenness on certain platforms when building with -DDEBUG.
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=381783
      +1 sctemme, fielding, pquerna, jerenkrantz
      -1 niq: Why are we hacking a third-party package as bundled,
              rather than upstream?  This has potential for chaos
              for modules (and we have a history of PCRE trouble)
              as well as a maintenance nightmare!
      jerenkrantz: I don't believe that's a valid reason to block this.
                   We're bundling PCRE for the duration of the 2.2.x series,
                   but we can re-evaluate for future major/minor revs.

    * PKCS#7: backport PCKS#7 patches from trunk.
      +1 ben
      jerenkrantz: What's the revision number to backport?

    * mod_deflate: Rework inflate output and deflate output filter to fix
      several issues: Incorrect handling of flush buckets, potential memory
      leaks, excessive memory usage in inflate output filter for large
      compressed content

        Trunk versions work. For convenience of review I merged the patches
        for the deflate output filter and the inflate output filter:

            Merged subversion comments: http://people.apache.org/~rpluem/patches/mod_deflate_rework/inflate_output.log
