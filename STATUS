CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
      that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
      made in the trunk.

    * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
      as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
      get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
      branches/2.2.x, as applicable.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

   * Awaiting next apr-util release to address licensing concerns.

                   As it is fundamentally different from the first approach I
                   would suggest to restart the voting.

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:

    * mod_dbd: When threaded, create a private pool in child_init
      so we're not using the process pool later.  Also improve
      configuration defaults and merge function.
      (this assumes Colm's windows-build fixes are also backported)
      http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=348026&view=rev
      http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=354400&view=rev
      +1 niq

    * Backport mod_authz_dbd (it's had some testing now)
      http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd/httpd/trunk/modules/aaa/mod_authz_dbd.c
      +1 niq
      -1 bnicholes - The authorization refactoring that was done is for 2.3 and above.
                     This can not be backported to 2.2.

    * Fix mis-shifted 32 bit scope, masked to 64 bits as a method, with
      improvement (?) suggested by jorton;
        URL: http://people.apache.org/~wrowe/fixldap_mask.patch
      +1: wrowe, pquerna

    * mod_include:  APR_FILEPATH_NOTABOVEROOT was undefined with
      a left-hand NULL or empty path.  The SECUREROOTPATH and 
      NOTABSOLUTE tests are sufficient for this application.  
      Adjust for this bug in earlier versions of APR that mishandled
      the NOTABOVEROOT flag with an empty left hand value.

    * mod_proxy_ajp: Crosscheck the length of the body chunk with the length
      of the ajp message to prevent readings beyond the buffer boundaries
      which possibly could reveal sensitive memory contents to the client.
