CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
      that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
      made in the trunk.

    * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
      as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
      get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
      branches/2.2.x, as applicable.

      +1: sctemme, rpluem, jim

    * mod_ssl: Move thread locking upcall initialization before
      hardware library initialization, so hardware library can use
      these upcalls when run in a threaded MPM. Fixes PR 20951. 
      Trunk version of patch applies: 

      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/trunk/modules/ssl/ssl_engine_init.c?r1=520701&r2=525709&view=patch
      
      +1: sctemme, rpluem, jim

   * support/htdbm.c: Enable crypt() support on platforms with crypt() but not
     <crypt.h>, such as z/OS.
     Trunk version of patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=526892
     2.2.x version of patch:
       Trunk version works
     +1: trawick, rpluem, jim

   * HTTP proxy ProxyErrorOverride: Leave 1xx and 3xx responses alone.  Only
     processing of error responses (4xx, 5xx) will be altered.  PR
     39245.
     Trunk version of patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=527969

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:

    * mod_proxy_ajp: Fix wrong retry when sending the response failed.
      PR 40310 (The old fix wasn't ok).
      Trunk version of patch:
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=518938
      (It also works for httpd-2.2.x).
      +1: jfclere

    * mpm_winnt: Fix return values from wait_for_many_objects.
      Note - this is required to avoid hangups of socket #64, #128
      as Microsoft set aside 64 reserved values.
      Trunk version of patch:
        http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=428029
      2.2.x version of patch:
        Trunk version works
        http://people.apache.org/~wrowe/mpm_winnt_waits.patch
        is easier to read (-U8)
      +1: mturk
      wrowe notes: a patch should have the necessary effect with the
        minimum lines of code - there's alot of redecorating that's
        going on in this patch to no net effect.  The WAIT_TIMEOUT
        result value seems to be ignored in the revised code?
      mturk notes: WAIT_TIMEOUT is replaced by WAIT_FAILED with
        the accompanied patch in mpm\winnt\child.c.

    * PKCS#7: backport PCKS#7 patches from trunk.
      +1 ben
      jerenkrantz: What's the revision number to backport?
      wrowe asks: ditto jerenkrantz

    * mod_proxy: Support variable interpolation in reverse proxy configuration
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=421686  (code)
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=422178  (code)
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/manual/mod/mod_proxy.xml?r1=420990&r2=421725 (docs)
      +1: niq, mturk
      -.9: wrowe notes; modifying the existing syntax seems inappropriate, new
           ProxyPassSubstitute or similarly named directives would seem to
           make more sense, permit direct Reverse'als when appropriate and
           restrict the Substitutions to be parsed only when required.

   * mod_authn_dbd: Export any additional columns queried in the SQL select
     into the environment with the name AUTHENTICATE_<COLUMN>. This brings
     mod_authn_dbd behaviour in line with mod_authnz_ldap.
     Trunk: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=466865
     +1: minfrin
     niq: This wants a little tidying.  Use of 13 as a magic number (for a
          strlen of something defined elsewhere) is nasty.  More importantly
          you need to document how it affects the module's directives.
          I'll +1 it when that's done.
     wrowe: ditto's - good concept.

   * mod_cache: Correctly cache objects whose URL query string has been
     modified by mod_rewrite.
        PR: 40805
     Trunk version of patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=476625
     2.2.x version of patch:
       Trunk version works

   * mod_cache: While serving a cached entity ensure that filters that have
     been applied to this cached entity before saving it to the cache are not
     applied again.
