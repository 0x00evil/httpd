CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
      that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
      made in the trunk.

    * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
      as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
      get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
      branches/2.2.x, as applicable.

          Trunk version works

      niq: the new comment isn't accurate; it applies to any brigade
      containing only (one or more) zero-length buckets.  The existing
      comment misled my review!  Fix the comment and you have my +1
      for the fix.
      jim: agrees with niq.
      rpluem: Does http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=395381&view=rev address
              the concerns (BTW: Same text as colm used in the backport to 2.0.x
              (r395197))?
              jim, does your agreement with niq also include his +1 in the case
              the comment is fixed?

    * arch win32: http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=395419&view=rev
      s|/GX |/EHsc | because they were always synonyms, and Visual Studio
      2005 edition complains bitterly and loudly that /GX is deprecated.
      Note that only -debug- compiles are even affected by the change,
      and although the patch looks long, it's 4 characters per file, 1 line.
