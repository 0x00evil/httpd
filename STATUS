CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
      that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
      made in the trunk.

    * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
      as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
      get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
      branches/2.2.x, as applicable.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:

   * mod_proxy: Add explicit fushing feature.
     When Servlet container sends AJP body message with size 0,
     this means that Servlet container has asked for an explicit flush.
     Create flush bucket in that case. This feature has been added
     to the recent Tomcat versions without breaking the AJP protocol.
     Trunk:http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=468941

    * mpm_winnt: Fix return values from wait_for_many_objects.
      Trunk version of patch:
        http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=428029
      2.2.x version of patch:
        Trunk version works
      +1: mturk

    * Bundled PCRE: backport r381783 from trunk
      Fix brokenness on certain platforms when building with -DDEBUG.
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=381783
      +1 sctemme, fielding, pquerna, jerenkrantz
      -1 niq: Why are we hacking a third-party package as bundled,
              rather than upstream?  This has potential for chaos
              for modules (and we have a history of PCRE trouble)
              as well as a maintenance nightmare!
      jerenkrantz: I don't believe that's a valid reason to block this.
                   We're bundling PCRE for the duration of the 2.2.x series,
                   but we can re-evaluate for future major/minor revs.

    * PKCS#7: backport PCKS#7 patches from trunk.
      +1 ben
      jerenkrantz: What's the revision number to backport?

    * mod_deflate: Rework inflate output and deflate output filter to fix
      several issues: Incorrect handling of flush buckets, potential memory
      leaks, excessive memory usage in inflate output filter for large
      compressed content
        PR: 39854

      2.2.x version of patch:
        Trunk versions work. For convenience of review I merged the patches
        for the deflate output filter and the inflate output filter:
          Changes on deflate output filter:
            Patch: http://people.apache.org/~rpluem/patches/mod_deflate_rework/deflate_output.diff
            Merged subversion comments: http://people.apache.org/~rpluem/patches/mod_deflate_rework/deflate_output.log
          Changes on inflate output filter:
            Patch: http://people.apache.org/~rpluem/patches/mod_deflate_rework/inflate_output.diff
            Merged subversion comments: http://people.apache.org/~rpluem/patches/mod_deflate_rework/inflate_output.log
        The patch for the inflate output filter requires the patch for the
        deflate output filter.

    * mod_mem_cache: Convert mod_mem_cache to use APR memory pool functions
      by creating a root pool for object persistence across requests. This
      also eliminates the need for custom serialization code.

    * core: Orphaned piped logger process after graceful restart

      Trunk version of patch:
        http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=452431
      2.2.x version of patch:
        Trunk version works
      +1: rpluem

    * mod_authnz_ldap: Add an AuthLDAPRemoteUserAttribute directive. If
      set, REMOTE_USER will be set to this attribute, rather than the
      username supplied by the user. Useful for example when you want users
      to log in using an email address, but need to supply a userid instead
      to the backend.
      Trunk: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=463427

   * mod_dumpio: Allow logging at other LogLevels via DumpIOLogLevel
     directive.

      2.2.x version of patch:

      +1: jim

   * mod_dbd: Key the storage of prepared statements on the hex string
     value of server_rec, rather than the server name, as the server name
     may change (eg when the server name is set) at any time, causing
     weird behaviour in modules dependent on mod_dbd.
     Trunk: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=466641
     niq: This is actually cumulative with R432562, R432560, 424798
          which were not yet backported.  They fix a nasty bug,
          and minfrin's fix is better than mine.
     Cumulative patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/trunk/modules/database/mod_dbd.c?r1=466641&r2=420983&pathrev=466641
     +1: minfrin, niq

   * mod_authn_dbd: Export any additional columns queried in the SQL select
     into the environment with the name AUTHENTICATE_<COLUMN>. This brings
     mod_authn_dbd behaviour in line with mod_authnz_ldap.
     Trunk: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=466865
     +1: minfrin
     niq: This wants a little tidying.  Use of 13 as a magic number (for a
          strlen of something defined elsewhere) is nasty.  More importantly
          you need to document how it affects the module's directives.
          I'll +1 it when that's done.

   * Fix address-in-use startup failure caused by corruption of the list of
     listen sockets in some configurations with multiple generic Listen
     directives.

     and, as a result, semi-depreciate Lockfile.
