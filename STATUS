RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * configure breakage
	mod_perl build is broken (CFLAGS not picked up from libperl.module)

    * Version component misbehaviour
        See: <36738822.D2FD6C0@lyra.org>
        Status: Ralf mentioned that he knows a solution... (?)
	Is this the module placing it's token first? If so, I have

    * nmake compilation broken on Win95
      Paul Ausbeck says the problem is that the distribution uses

RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * How should an Apache binary release tarball look?
    
      - A proposed solution is available.
        See: <XFMail.981213175013.sfx@unix-ag.org>
             <XFMail.981226052910.sfx@unix-ag.org>

      1. The "old" way where it is just a source release tarball
         plus a pre-compiled src/httpd-<gnutriple>. It is created
         via the apache-devsite/binbuild.sh script which
         - creates the build tree
         - creates the src/Configuration file with standard modules
         - runs "make"
         - renames src/httpd to src/httpd-<gnutriple>
         - runs "make clean"
         - packs the build tree stuff together
         Already known discussion points:
         - should src/httpd be renamed or not because a lot
           of PRs say they cannot find the httpd :-(
         Status: Ralf -0, Ken +0

      2. The way some other projects release binary tarballs, i.e.
         a package containing the installed (binary) files.
         It can be created by a script which
         - creates the build tree
         - runs "./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache \
                             --enable-shared=remain \
                             --disable-module=auth_db \
                             --enable-suexec ..."
         - runs "make install root=apache-root"
         - packs the stuff together from ./apache-root only!!
         Already known discussion points:
         - should there be a prefix usr/local/apache in 
           the tarball or not?  Some people think
           it's useful while others dislike it a lot.
	 - it doesn't include the source.
	 - the paths don't match the original Apache style, nor the Win32
	   paths
	 - should suexec be prebuilt in a binary tarball?
         Status: Ralf +1, Martin +1, Roy -1, Ken +1 (IFF source is included,
		 there's no usr/local/apache prefix in the tarball, AND the
		 old-style [common with Win32] paths are used)

      3. A source release tarball with three extra directories:
            lib: for the shared library object files
            bin: for the httpd and support executables
            man: for the man files (if desired)
         as if the server was installed in those directories.
         Status: Roy +1, Jim +1 (still need to define which modules
	 	 are built)
                 Ralf -0 (I dislike mixed source+binary tarballs)

Documentation that needs writing:

    * Need a document explaining mod_rewrite/"UseCanonicalName off" based
      virtualhosting.  (If it exists already I can't find it easily.)
      => It still doesn't exists but I've already assembled the relevant
         information and config snippets. We just have to write a
         vhost-xxx.html document out of it. -- rse

		fopen()" bug has been identified, but analysis on how
		to fix it continues."

Needs patch:

    * get_path_info bug; ap_get_remote_host should be ap_vformatter instead.
      See: <Pine.LNX.3.96dg4.980427034301.16648P-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>

    * uri issues
	- RFC2068 requires a server to recognize its own IP addr(s) in dot
	notation, we do this fine if the user follows the dns-caveats
	documentation... we should handle it in the case the user doesn't ever
	supply a dot-notation address.

    * Problems dealing with .-rooted domain names such as "twinlark." versus
	"twinlark.arctic.org.".  See the thread containing
	Message-ID: <19980203211817.06723@deejai.mch.sni.de> for more details.
	In particular this affects the correctness of the proxy and the
	vhost mechanism.

    * proxy_*_canon routines use r->proxyreq incorrectly.  See
	<Pine.LNX.3.96dg4.980304030057.13656O-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>

    * work around a Navigator/Mozilla bug when mod_proxy is used
      (broken images).
	Message-ID: <XFMail.980802025055.sfx@unix-ag.org>
        Status: Lars' patch was vetoed.  Roy and Dean think that it is
                probably another buffer magic number error and should be
                tested to find out and, if so, fixed like it was in core.

    * ap_escape_html() always duplicates the string, even when there is
      no change and the caller would be happy to use the original.
      What is needed is a separate interface for "don't need a dup"
      situations, like just about everywhere we use it in bvputs and
      bputs calls.

Open issues:

    * Underscores on symbols in DSO situation is broken for NetBSD:
      Here is a private conversation between me (rse) and Charles Hannum of
      the NetBSD project:

      From: "Charles M. Hannum" <mycroft@netbsd.org>
      > We have a bug report at the Apache BugDB (see
      > http://bugs.apache.org/private/index/full/2462) where a user says
      > under a particular NetBSD platform (NetBSD/pmax 1.3.2) the symbols on
      > dlsym() don't need an underscore.  In FreeBSD world we always had the
      > underscore,
      > [...]                               
      This is less an issue of OS, and more an issue of a.out vs. ELF.  The
      underscores are always used for a.out, and are never used for ELF.
      Therefore, on any platform where we use ELF (that would be Alpha, MIPS,
      PowerPC and UltraSPARC currently, although there are plans to eventually
      switch on other platforms), the underscores should not be added, and on
      all other platforms they should be.
      You can differentiate by comparing the output of `uname -m' with any
      of: alpha bebox macppc newsmips ofppc pica pmax sparc64.

    * Redefine APACHE_RELEASE. Add another 'bit' to signify whether
      it's a beta or final release. Maybe 'MMNNFFRBB' which means:
        MM: Major release #
	NN: Minor release #
	FF: "fix" level
	R:  0 if beta, 1 if final release
	BB: beta number

      See: <199806071444.KAA23147@devsys.jaguNET.com>
      Status: Jim +1, Ben +1, Martin +1, Ralf +1

    * Someone other than Dean has to do a security/correctness review on
      psprintf(), bprintf(), and ap_snprintf().  In particular these routines
      do lots of fun pointer manipulations and such and possibly have overflow
      errors.  The respective flush_funcs also need to be exercised.
       o Jim's looked over the ap_snprintf() stuff (the changes that Dean
         did to make thread-safe) and they look fine.
       o Laura La Gassa's looked over ap_vformatter & other related code
       o Martin did a "source review" as well.
       o Could still use 1 or 2 more sets of eyeballs.
       Status: Is this still valid??

    * Paul would like to see a 'gdbm' option because he uses
      it a lot.

    * Maybe a http_paths.h file? See

	+1: Brian, Paul, Ralf, Martin
	+0: Jim (not for 1.3.0)

    * Release builds: Should we provide Configuration or not?
      Should we 'make all suexec' in src/support?
	+1: Brian, Jim, Ken +1 (possible suexec path issue, though)

    * root's environment is inherited by the Apache server. Jim & Ken
      think we should recommend using 'env' to build the
      appropriate environment. Marc and Alexei don't see any
      big deal. Martin says that not every "env" has a -u flag.

    * Marc's socket options like source routing (kill them?)
	Marc, Martin say Yes

    * Ken's PR#1053: an error when accessing a negotiated document
      explicitly names the variant selected.  Should it do so, or should
      the original URI be referenced?

    * Proposed API Changes:

	- r->content_language is for backwards compatibility... with modules
	  that may not link any longer without some minor editing.  The new
	  field is r->content_languages.  Heck it's not even mentioned in
	  apache-devsite/mmn.txt when we got content_languages (note the s!).
	  The proposal is to remove r->content_language:
	    Status: Paul +1, Ralf +1, Ken +1, Martin +1

	- child_exit() is redundant, it can be implemented via cleanups.  It is
	  not "symmetric" in the sense that there is no exit API method to go
	  along with the init() API method.  There is no need for an exit
	  method, there are already modules using cleanups to perform this (see
	  mod_mmap_static, and mod_php3 for example).  The proposal is to
	  remove the child_exit() method and document cleanups as the method of
	  handling this need.
	    Status: Rasmus +1, Paul +1, Jim +1, 
	            Martin +1, Ralf +1, Ken +1

    * Should we re-enable nagle now that we're non-buffering CGIs?  See
      various messages from Marc in March 98.
  
    * TZ should not be dealt with specially any longer now that we have
      "PassEnv".  See
      <Pine.LNX.3.96dg4.980309224241.11283X-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>
       Jim: IMO it's too late in the game for this... I'm
            sure this would cause some strange bug reports as
	    people's cgi-scripts no longer work correctly
	    ("It worked just fine before I upgraded to 1.3.0")
	    unless we warn people in big nasty letters to add
	    PassEnv TZ to their config files "just in case"
	    and hope they do it :)

    * In ap_bclose() there's no test that (fb->fd != -1) -- so it's
      possible that it'll do something completely bogus when it's 
      used for read-only things. - Dean Gaudet

    * Okay, so our negotiation strategy needs a bit of refinement.  See
      <Pine.LNX.3.96dg4.980429182338.15569d-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>.
      In general, we need to go through and clean up the negotiation
      module to make it compliant with the final HTTP/1.1 draft, and at the
      very least we should make it more copacetic to the idea of transferring
      gzipped variants of files when both variants exist on the server.

    * Roy's HTTP/1.1 Wishlist items:
        1) byte range error handling
        2) update the Accept-Encoding parser to allow q-values

    * use of spawnvp in uncompress_child in mod_mime_magic - doesn't
      use the new child_info structure, is this still safe?  Needs to be 
      looked at.

    * suexec doesn't understand argv parameters; e.g.

        <!--#exec cmd="./ls -l" -->

      fails even when "ls" is in the same directory because suexec is trying
      to stat a file called "ls -l".  A patch for this is available at

        http://www.xnet.com/~emarshal/suexec.diff

      and it's not bad except that it doesn't handle programs with spaces in
      the filename (think win32, or samba-mounted filesystems).  There are
      several PR's to this and I don't see for security reasons why we can't
      accomodate it, though it does add complexity to suexec.c.

	Ken: What's W95-specific about it?

 Help:

    * should trap ^C when running not-as-service and do proper shutdown

    * should have a pretty little icon for Apache on Win32

    * proxy module doesn't load on Win95.  Why?  Good question.  PR#1462.
    
    * Proxy cache garbage collection doesn't work. PR#1891

    * "Directory /", "Directory C:/" both fail to do anything, 
      while "Directory *" SEGVs.

    * chdir() for CGI scripts and mod_include #exec needs to be 
      re-implemented now that CreateProcess is being used.

    * process/thread model
	- need dynamic thread creation/destruction, similar to 
	  Unix process model
	- can't use WaitForMultipleObjects in the same way we
	  do now, since that has a limit of 64(!) objects.  Grr.
	  PR#1665

    * some errors printed by CGIs to stderr don't end up making it
      to the server log unless an extra debugging message is added
      after they run? (PR#1725 indicates this may not be just Win32)

    * handle bugs that make it pop up errors on console, ie. segv 
      equiv?  Can we do this?  Need to make it robust.

    * install
	- make installshield work
	- config in cvs tree?
	- install docs, etc.?
	- location for install

    * the mutex should be critical-regions, since the current design
      is creating a mess of SO calls that are unnecessary

    * we don't mmap on NT.  Use TransmitFile?

    * CGIs
	- docs on how they work w/scripts
	- use registry to find interpreter?
	- WTF is the buffering coming from?
	    - we don't have a way to make non-blocking files on NT!

    * performance

    * documentation:
	- running the server without admin
	- how CGIs work
	- update README.NT
	- short/long name handling
	- better status page on current state of NT for users

    * http_main.c hell
	- split into two files?

    * who should run the service?  Who exactly is the "system account"?

      docs say:

      Localsystem is a very privileged account locally, so you shouldn't run
      any shareware applications there. However, it has no network privileges
      and cannot leave the machine via any NT-secured mechanism, including
      file system, named pipes, DCOM, or secure RPC.

      and:

      A service that runs in the context of the LocalSystem account
      inherits the security context of the SCM. It is not associated with
      any logged-on user account and does not have credentials (domain
      name, user name, and password) to be used for verification. This
      has several implications: [... removed ...]


      That _really_ sucks.  Can we recommend running Apache as some 
      other user?

    * need a crypt() of some sort.
	- sources are easy; problem is export restrictions on DES
	- if we don't do DES, can do md5

    * modules that need to be made to work on win32
        - mod_example isn't multithreadreded
	- mod_unique_id (needs mt changes)
	- mod_auth_db.c  (do we want to even try this?  We should have some
          db of some sort... what else can we pick from under win32?)
	- mod_auth_dbm.c
	- mod_info.c (PR#1442 re exporting symbols for it...)
	- mod_log_agent.c
	- mod_log_referer.c
	- mod_mime_magic.c (needs access to mod_mime API stage...)

    * do something to disable bogus warnings

    * rfc1413.c has static storage which won't work multithreaded

    * mod_include --> exec cgi, exec cmd, etc. don't work right.
      Looks like a code path that isn't run anywhere else that has
      something not quite right...  A PR or two on it.

    * signal type handling
    	- how to rotate logs from command line?
	  (Point people to Andrew Ford's cronolog because it's "better"
	   than ours?)

    * Currently if you double click on the conf files or the
      log files you get a useless dialog offering the set of all
      executables, usually after a very long pause.  Ought
      to stuff .conf in the registry mapping it to text.

    * apparently either "BrowserMatch" or the "nokeepalive" variable
      cause instability - see PR#1729.

Binaries
   The goal here is to have two columns of all-Y (where applicable)
   for the two stable release versions, and nothing under Old unless
   the new version just doesn't work on that platform.
