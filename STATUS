Available Patches:


Concepts:

    * Ralf's [CONTRIB] AutoConf Interface Emulation
        <199803020729.IAA20122@en1.engelschall.com>
        (idea: GNU-style {configure,Makefile.tmpl} replaces existing 
        but incomplete {Makefile,src/helpers/InstallApache}) 
        Status: Ralf +1   (for 1.3.0 because either now or better never to
                           avoid confusion later in the release cycle)
                Jim +1    (for 1.3.1 on concept)
                Jim -1    (for 1.3.0 because too late)
                Randy -1  (too late for 1.3 in general)
                Ken -1    (for 1.3.0 in general)

    * Dean's [PRE-PATCH] expanding ap_snprintf()
	<Pine.LNX.3.95dg3.971023233600.4431I-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>
	Status: Dean +1, Ben +1, Jim 0, Martin 0, Brian +1(?), Ken +1
	See <Pine.LNX.3.95dg3.971024175935.25347U-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>
	for a more up-to-date idea (int vformatter) that has a
	vote of +1 from Dean, Ben, Martin, Paul, Jim, and Ken for concept

In progress:

    * Dean's [PATCH] yet another slow function
        <Pine.LNX.3.95dg3.980106142612.1054W-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>
	Status: Dean +1, Jim +1, Martin +1, Paul +1
	Needs to be redone so that it better supports non-ascii hosts.

    * Ken's IndexFormat enhancement to mod_autoindex to allow
      CustomLog-like tailoring of directory listing formats

    * Doug's attempt to get mod_perl's <Perl> config working under win32,
      some "non-public" functions and structures need to exposed

Needs patch:

    * Dean's "locale" project
	See <Pine.LNX.3.95dg3.971219001345.7010F-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>
    
    * os_ abstract is_only_below() in mod_include.c

    * proxy security fixes from 1.2.5 need to be brought forward

    * Documentation for:
      1) htdocs/manual/sourcereorg.html and other files should mention 
         new mod_so capabilities.
      2) windows.html should be cleaned up.

    * uri issues (dean will do unless someone else wants 'em):
	- RFC2068 requires a server to recognize its own IP addr(s) in dot
	notation, we do this fine if the user follows the dns-caveats
	documentation... we should handle it in the case the user doesn't ever
	supply a dot-notation address.

Closed issues:

    * Removal of inetd mode
	Ken says he'll try to maintain it, since there are
	people/places who need it

    * The decision has been made to experiment with allowing code
      changes to be committed without prior review.

    * Guidelines for commit-then-review are documented at
      <http://dev.apache.org/guidelines.html#ctr>

    * The "apache" CVS module has been renamed to "apache-1.2" and the
      "apachen" module to "apache-1.3".  "apache-1.3" has been copied
      to "apache-2.0", but whether that's appropriate or not is
      under discussion.  A couple of people want that module to
      start empty rather than full of 1.3's stuff.

Open issues:

    * Provide consistant prefixes; suggestions:

      Apache provided general functions (e.g., ap_cpystrn)
	ap_xxx: Ken +1, Brian +1, Ralf +1, Martin +1, Paul +1

      Public API functions (e.g., palloc)
	apapi_xxx: Ken +1, Brian +1, Ralf +1, Martin +1, Paul
	appublic_xxx:
	appub_xxx:

      Private functions which we can't make static
      but should be (e.g., new_connection)
	apprivate_xxx:
	appri_xxx: Brian +1
	httpd_xxx: Ken +1
	apint_xxx: Ralf +1 (int = internal)

    * Ken's [POLL] apachen/patches directory
      Shall we experiment with allowing patches to be distributed for
      voting through cvs, by creating a directory under the source tree
      and putting them there?  Please vote.
	<34B8EE39.43F32BE0@Golux.Com>
	Status: Ken +1, Randy 0, Dean 0, Jim +1, Paul 0, Martin +1, Ralf 0

    * Paul would like to see a 'gdbm' option because he uses
      it a lot. Dean notes that 'gdbm' include 'db' support
      so we need to watch the library ordering.

	Dean notes:  Check rev 1.72 -> rev 1.73 of
	src/Configuration.tmpl.  I re-ordered mod_auth_dbm and
	mod_auth_db at this time, and I'm pretty sure it was to
	deal with this issue.  But I think I still ran into
	troubles if I automatically looked for gdbm.

    * What do we call the binary: apache or httpd? Under UNIX
      it's httpd, under Win32 it's apache. Maybe rename it
      to apache-httpd?
	apache-httpd: Ken +1
        leave it apache: Brian +1, Ralf +1

    * Maybe a http_paths.h file? See
	<Pine.BSF.3.95q.971209222046.25627D-100000@valis.worldgate.com>
	Dean +1, Brian +1, Paul +1

    * Release builds: Should we provide Configuration or not?
      Should we 'make all suexec' in src/support?
	Ken +1 (possible suexec path issue, though)
        Brian +1

    * root's environment is inherited by the Apache server. Jim, Ken &
      Dean thinks we should recommend using 'env' to build the
      appropriate environment. Marc and Alexei don't see any
      big deal. Martin says that not every "env" has a -u flag.

    * 206 vs. 200 issue on Content-Length
	See <Pine.BSF.3.95q.971102000930.5555B-100000@valis.worldgate.com>
	Roy says current behavior is correct, but Alexei disagrees.
	Marc sides with Alexei.

    * Marc's socket options like source routing (kill them?)
	Marc, Dean, Martin say Yes

    * Marc's [BUG] include virtual and SCRIPT_NAME w/path_info
	<Pine.BSF.3.95.970928122038.21692C-100000@alive.znep.com>

    * Ken's PR#1053: an error when accessing a negotiated document
      explicitly names the variant selected.  Should it do so, or should
      the base input name be referenced?

    * Proposed API Changes:

	- r->content_language is for backwards compatibility... with modules
	  that may not link any longer without some minor editing.  The new
	  field is r->content_languages.  Heck it's not even mentioned in
	  apache-devsite/mmn.txt when we got content_languages (note the s!).
	  The proposal is to remove r->content_language:
	    Status: Dean +1, Paul +1

	- child_exit() is redundant, it can be implemented via cleanups.  It is
	  not "symmetric" in the sense that there is no exit API method to go
	  along with the init() API method.  There is no need for an exit
	  method, there are already modules using cleanups to perform this (see
	  mod_mmap_static, and mod_php3 for example).  The proposal is to
	  remove the child_exit() method and document cleanups as the method of
	  handling this need.
	    Status: Dean +1, Rasmus +1, Paul +1

Win32 specific issues:

 Open issues:

    * Should ApacheCore.dll be merged back into the main server
      image?  May make debugging easier..

 In progress:

    * Ben's ASP work... All agree it sounds cool.

    * DDA's adding a tray application to the Windoze version for ease of
      status/management.
	<01BCDB29.2C04DEB0@caravan.individual.com>
	<01BCDB2A.F8C09010@caravan.individual.com>
	Status: Ken +1, Sameer +1, Martin +1, Ben +1 (as long as
	we get a single executable)
	Paul: No like Win95 specific stuff
	Ken: What's W95-specific about it?

 Help:

    * process/thread model
	- need dynamic thread creation/destruction, similar to 
	  Unix process model
	- can't use WaitForMultipleObjects in the same way we
	  do now, since that has a limit of 64(!) objects.  Grr.
	  PR#1665

    * some errors printed by CGIs to stderr don't end up making it
      to the server log unless an extra debugging message is added
      after they run? (PR#1725 indicates this may not be just Win32)

    * bad use of chdir in some places; it isn't thread-specific

    * handle bugs that make it pop up errors on console, ie. segv 
      equiv?  Can we do this?  Need to make it robust.

    * install
	- make installshield work
	- config in cvs tree?
	- install docs, etc.?
	- location for install

    * signal type handling
    	- how to rotate logs from command line?

    * the mutex should be critical-regions, since the current design
      is creating a mess of SO calls that are unnecessary

    * we don't mmap on NT.  Use TransmitFile?

    * CGIs
        - hangs on multiple CGI execution?  PR#1607,1129
    	    Marc can't repeat...
	- docs on how they work w/scripts
	- use registry to find interpreter?
	- WTF is the buffering coming from?
	    - we don't have a way to make non-blocking files on NT!

    * performance

    * documentation:
	- running the server without admin
	- how CGIs work
	- update README.NT
	- short/long name handling
	- better status page on current state of NT for users

    * http_main.c hell
	- split into two files?

    * who should run the service?  Who exactly is the "system account"?

      docs say:

      Localsystem is a very privileged account locally, so you shouldn't run
      any shareware applications there. However, it has no network privileges
      and cannot leave the machine via any NT-secured mechanism, including
      file system, named pipes, DCOM, or secure RPC.

      and:

      A service that runs in the context of the LocalSystem account
      inherits the security context of the SCM. It is not associated with
      any logged-on user account and does not have credentials (domain
      name, user name, and password) to be used for verification. This
      has several implications: [... removed ...]


      That _really_ sucks.  Can we recommend running Apache as some 
      other user?


    * need a crypt() of some sort.
	- sources are easy; problem is export restrictions on DES
	- if we don't do DES, can do md5

    * modules that need to be made to work on win32
        - mod_example isn't multithreadreded
	- mod_unique_id (needs mt changes)
	- mod_auth_db.c  (do we want to even try this?  We should have some
          db of some sort... what else can we pick from under win32?)
	- mod_auth_dbm.c
	- mod_info.c (PR re exporting symbols for it...)
	- mod_log_agent.c
	- mod_log_referer.c
	- mod_mime_magic.c (needs access to mod_mime API stage...)

    * do something to disable bogus warnings

    * rfc1413.c has static storage which won't work multithreaded

    * mod_include --> exec cgi, exec cmd, etc. don't work right.
      Looks like a code path that isn't run anywhere else that has
      something not quite right...  A PR or two on it.

WIN32 1.3 FINAL RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * SECURITY: PR#1203 still needs to be dealt with for WIN32

    * SECURITY: check if the magic con/aux/nul/etc names do anything
	really bad

    * SECURITY: numerous uses of strcpy and strcat have potential
	for buffer overflow, someone should rewrite or verify
	they're safe
