CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.4.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur after 2.4.1.  Such changes can
    only be made in the trunk.

  * All commits to branches/2.4.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk
    then merge into branches/2.4.x, as applicable.

  * Current exceptions for RTC for this branch:
    . mod_lua
    . documentation
    . non-Unix build
    . non-Unix, single-platform code

PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]
 
  * mod_dir: provide a directive to skip mod_dir processing if any other
    handler has been configured, as in 2.2.

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

  * mod_auth_form: Make sure the optional functions are loaded even when
    the AuthFormProvider isn't specified.
    trunk patch: https://svn.apache.org/r1531672
    2.4.x patch: trunk patch works, modulo CHANGES
    +1: minfrin, jim
    -0 covener: does that mean just loading mod_auth_form w/o mod_request 
                and mod_filter now causes a post-config failure?
    minfrin: It does, however it would only affect configs where mod_auth_form
             has been loaded but not used, as any attempt to use mod_auth_form
             without mod_request and mod_session present would cause the very
             same failure. Would a warning in the release notes be good enough?
 
   * mod_slotmem_shm: Remove wonky and dangerous code that knows about APR
     internals. We work fine w/o it anyway at this stage.

     [wrowe asks] Where is verification of (!keepalive)?  Do we know the
                  connection will be closed anytime in the near future?
     ylavic: proposed for backport in 2.2.x, same comment here :

   * mod_proxy: Don't reuse a SSL backend connection whose SNI differs. PR 55782.

     +1 fuankg, gsmith
     -.8: trawick
          This commit is essentially deciding that an httpd install on
          Windows now has printenv/testcgi written in 2 more languages.
          To the extent that the usefulness is that it shows how to make scripts
          of these types executable by httpd, I believe that the documentation
          is the proper place to solve that.  To the extent that the usefullness
          is to show how to implement a CGI in these particular languages, I believe
          that the httpd distribution and documentation in general is not the
          place for that.  Historically these types of scripts have caused problems
          for downstream vendorsas well as newbies (and sometimes the intersection
          of those two groups) who don't understand that these are information leaks
          once they are enabled, and the subtlety of the way they are disabled ("Apache
          messed up the first line; let me fix that") contributes to that.
     fuankg notes: I've just added a big warning to all CGI scripts which should now
          make absolutely clear that these CGIs are for testing purpose only - so those
          who enable those scripts with inserting the right shebang should be 100% aware
          of any risks (this should cover your last point).
     jim: trawick, does the above address your concerns?
     trawick: to some extent (somebody reading the script gets an idea)
          Why isn't the configuration requirement documented instead
          of described indirectly in a sample?
          Why are these new samples added to the install without three
          votes?  (I didn't veto it; put your name next to the two
          existing ones and I'll be satisified that enough people
          considered this addition as an appropriate solution for a
          real httpd usability problem.)
     wrowe: I'd agree with trawick, and suggest that these scripts can begin
            their life somewhere in the manual/ tree.  This really seems like
            the place where /usr/share/httpd/examples/ would be useful, but
            there isn't an ordinary directory for that.  Since we want none
            of the scripts to function 'out of the box', what about a new
            cgi-examples/ dir alongside cgi-bin/? Otherwise manual/cgi/examples
            might work?
