CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
    made in the trunk.

  * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
    get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
    branches/2.2.x, as applicable.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

 * SECURITY: CVE-2009-1891 (cve.mitre.org)
   Fix a potential Denial-of-Service attack against mod_deflate or
   other modules, by forcing the server to consume CPU time in
   compressing a large file after a client disconnects.
   2.2.x patches:
     http://people.apache.org/~jorton/CVE-2009-1891.1.diff
     http://people.apache.org/~jorton/CVE-2009-1891.2.diff
   Trunk version of patch:
     #1 folded in during core output filter refactoring
     #2 http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=521681
   +1: jorton, jim, rpluem
   rpluem asks: Are we sure that b is never NULL?
   Otherwise we would need to add
   http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=568202
   as on trunk to avoid segfaults.
   trawick responds: if b were NULL, we would have segfaulted earlier
     when ap_pass_brigade "calls" APR_BRIGADE_LAST(bb)
   rpluem: Ahh good point. Meanwhile I had a look at trunk and the
   event MPM is calling the core output filter directly without
   ap_pass_brigade. So I am +1.

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

 * prefork MPM: simple patch to enable mod_privileges.
   trunk: N/A (this patch substitutes for the availability of
               drop_privileges hook).
   2.2.x patch:
      http://people.apache.org/~niq/patches/2.2mod_privileges-core-patch
   wrowe asks; what is proposed and why two patches here?
   niq replies: removing the second one, it's FYI only and not part
                of the backport proposal.  And it needs updating!
   +1: niq

 * mod_alias: Ensure Redirect emits HTTP-compliant URLs.
   PR 44020
   trunk patch:
     http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=785575
   2.2.x patch:
     http://people.apache.org/~rpluem/patches/foreign_patches/niq_44020.diff
   NOTE: I'm recommending different versions because the trunk
   patch is too strict for a stable line and may "break" broken
   configs thought by their users to be working.

 * mod_cache: Add CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers directive to ignore
              defined session identifiers encoded in the URL when caching.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

  * srclib/pcre and vendor/pcre
    http://www.vuxml.org/freebsd/pkg-pcre.html

    update to pcre-7.8
    outcome: remove from trunk, leave alone in branches/2.2.x and branches/2.0.x

 * core, authn/z: Avoid calling access control hooks for internal requests
   with configurations which match those of initial request.  Revert to
   original behaviour (call access control hooks for internal requests
   with URIs different from initial request) if any access control hooks or
   providers are not registered as permitting this optimization.
   Introduce wrappers for access control hook and provider registration
   which can accept additional mode and flag data.  Convert common
   provider version strings to macros.
   The core purpose of this pile of patches is to avoid unnecessary
   authn/z hooks when a single request spawns large numbers of internal
   requests to which an identical set of httpd configurations apply.
   This permits modules such as mod_authn_dbd and mod_dav to work together
   acceptably.
   Because certain external modules such as mod_authz_svn rely on the old
   behaviour, this optimization can be made only when all authn/z hooks and
   providers are registered with the appropriate flag.
   It would be excellent if Windows and NetWare people could ensure this
   builds correctly.
   In particular, mod_auth.h must be included into request.c and I've left
   mod_auth.h under modules/aaa rather than try to replicate wrowe's work
   in trunk moving all the include files around.
   I'm open to suggestions that this remain in trunk only, but in that case,
   it would be very helpful to know whether most people expect a 2.4 branch
   or just a 3.0 branch to be next.  If 3.0, some of the backwards
   compatibility work could potentially be ditched.

   * beos MPM: Create pmain pool and run modules' child_init hooks when
     entering ap_mpm_run(), then destroy pmain when exiting ap_mpm_run().
     Otherwise modules' child_init hooks appear to never be executed.
     Also, destroying pmain ensures that cleanups registered in modules'
     child_init hooks are performed (e.g., mod_log_config and mod_dbd).
