CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
      that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
      made in the trunk.

    * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
      as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
      get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
      branches/2.2.x, as applicable.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
    
    * mod_proxy: Fix the 503 returned when session route does
      not match any of the balancer members.
      Trunk version of patch:
        http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=556931
      +1: mturk
      
    * ApacheMonitor: Fix Windows Vista detection.
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=536052      
      +1: mturk
      wrowe notes post today to list, can we please test for >= VISTA
      so this doesn't break again upon the release of longhorn server
      or 'nextgen' windows?
      mturk notes: No, because we cannot be sure that any further version
      will not break either the service or GUI api, in which case we
      would need a separate code depending on the post VISTA versions.
 
    * mpm_winnt: Fix return values from wait_for_many_objects.
      Note - this is required to avoid hangups of socket #64, #128
      as Microsoft set aside 64 reserved values.
      Trunk version of patch:
        http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=428029
      2.2.x version of patch:
        Trunk version works
        http://people.apache.org/~wrowe/mpm_winnt_waits.patch
        is easier to read (-U8)
      +1: mturk
      +0: fielding (patch is okay, underlying code is crap)
      wrowe notes: a patch should have the necessary effect with the
        minimum lines of code - there's alot of redecorating that's
        going on in this patch to no net effect.  The WAIT_TIMEOUT
        result value seems to be ignored in the revised code?
      mturk notes: WAIT_TIMEOUT is replaced by WAIT_FAILED with
        the accompanied patch in mpm\winnt\child.c.
      fielding notes: the routine is brain-dead -- one cannot replicate
        a wait for many objects by iterating through multiple waits with
        a one second sleep in between loops.  That's insane.
        The right ways to do that are explained in the MSDN article
        <http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms687025.aspx>
        In any case, it should be checking nCount <= MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS
        first and use the simple wait in that case.

   * mod_authn_dbd: Export any additional columns queried in the SQL select
     into the environment with the name AUTHENTICATE_<COLUMN>. This brings
     mod_authn_dbd behaviour in line with mod_authnz_ldap.
     Trunk: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=466865
     +1: minfrin
     niq: This wants a little tidying.  Use of 13 as a magic number (for a
          strlen of something defined elsewhere) is nasty.  More importantly
          you need to document how it affects the module's directives.
          I'll +1 it when that's done.
     wrowe: ditto's - good concept.

   * mod_dbd: initialise resources and prepared statements in all vhosts
     PRs: 42327, 41302
     Trunk: N/A due to other changes (r503931 et al)
     Patch by bojan: http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=20161
     +1: niq
     -1: chrisd: I think r503931 is actually the right thing to backport here,
         which admittedly probably requires backporting r491729, r491884,
         r492394 (trivial), and r496831 first.  While more complex than a
         quick patch, I think the explanation in the fourth section of this
         post explains why there's no simple fix for the virtual-host
         inheritance issues:

         http://marc.info/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=116742014418304&w=2

         Doing this work would also let us close at least three PRs.
         PR 42327 seems like a duplicate of 41302 (both would be closed
         by r503931), and r496831 would close PR 39985 as well.

   * mod_dbd: Rename functions and variables for consistency, and move
     some functions around for readability, prior to making
     functional changes for PRs 39985, 41302, and other issues.
     Trunk version of patches:

         (relevant portions only)
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=521230
     2.2.x version of patch:
       http://people.apache.org/~chrisd/patches/mod_dbd_pools_groups/mod_dbd-1tidy-2.2.x.patch
     +1: chrisd, fuankg

   * mod_dbd: Handle error conditions in dbd_construct() properly.
     Simplify ap_dbd_open() and use correct arguments to apr_dbd_error()
     when non-threaded.  Register correct cleanup data in non-threaded
     ap_dbd_acquire() and ap_dbd_cacquire().  Clean up configuration data
     and merge function.  Use ap_log_error() wherever possible.
     Trunk version of patches:

       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=492394

     2.2.x version of patch:
       http://people.apache.org/~chrisd/patches/mod_dbd_pools_groups/mod_dbd-2misc-2.2.x.patch
     +1: chrisd

   * beos MPM: Create pmain pool and run modules' child_init hooks when
     entering ap_mpm_run(), then destroy pmain when exiting ap_mpm_run().
     Otherwise modules' child_init hooks appear to never be executed.
     Also, destroying pmain ensures that cleanups registered in modules'
     child_init hooks are performed (e.g., mod_log_config and mod_dbd).
     Trunk version of patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=491922
     2.2.x version of patch:
       http://people.apache.org/~chrisd/patches/mod_dbd_pools_groups/mpm_child_init-beos-2.2.x.patch
     +0: chrisd (abstaining; unable to test)

   * netware MPM: Destroy pmain pool when exiting ap_mpm_run() so that
     cleanups registered in modules' child_init hooks are performed (e.g.,
     mod_log_config and mod_dbd).
     Trunk version of patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=491907
     2.2.x version of patch:
       http://people.apache.org/~chrisd/patches/mod_dbd_pools_groups/mpm_child_init-netware-2.2.x.patch
     +0: chrisd (abstaining; unable to test)

   * mod_dbd: Create memory sub-pools for each DB connection and close
     DB connections in a pool cleanup function.  Ensure prepared statements
     are destroyed before DB connection is closed.  When using reslists,
     prevent segfaults when child processes exit, and stop memory leakage
     of ap_dbd_t structures.  Avoid use of global s->process->pool, which
     isn't destroyed by exiting child processes in most multi-process MPMs.

     dbd_setup() function.

     2.2.x version of patch:
       http://people.apache.org/~chrisd/patches/mod_dbd_pools_groups/mod_dbd-3pools-2.2.x.patch
     +1: chrisd

   * mod_dbd: Introduce configuration groups to allow inheritance by virtual
     hosts of database configurations from the main server.  Determine the
     minimal set of distinct configurations and share connection pools
     whenever possible.  Allow virtual hosts to override inherited SQL
     statements.  See also the fourth section of:
       http://marc.info/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=116742014418304&w=2
     and the eventual solution as implemented in the dbd_post_config()
     function.  Obviates r424798, r432560, r432562, and r466641.
     Could be improved by the addition of <DBDGroup> configuration
     sections.  (Any takers?  :-)

      -1: wrowe notes; modifying the existing syntax makes collaboration 
          impossible by an admin team - unexpected side effects and the rest.
          ProxyPassEnv* or ProxyPassSubstitute* directives that add this
          behavior on a pattern-by-pattern basis would win my -1 to a +1,
          and solve the performance hits noted by niq on an 80/20 basis.
