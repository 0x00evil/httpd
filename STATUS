CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
      that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
      made in the trunk.

    * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
      as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
      get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
      branches/2.2.x, as applicable.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

    * Remove odd DECLINED code from mod_charset_lite filter.
      http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=399665&view=rev
      +1 trawick, rpluem, niq
      niq: This is right, but the underlying behaviour (refuse to
      work in a proxy) is bad.  There's a TODO.

    * mod_charset_lite: Don't go through the motions of translating if
      the source and dest charsets are the same.
      http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=399668&view=rev
      +1 trawick, rpluem, niq

    * Backport mod_authz_dbd (it's had some testing now)
      http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd/httpd/trunk/modules/aaa/mod_authz_dbd.c
      +1 niq
      -1 bnicholes - The authorization refactoring that was done is for 2.3 and above.
                     This can not be backported to 2.2.

    * Fix dbd merge_config function to support prepared statements
      PR#39386
