Contributors looking for a mission:

  * Just do an egrep on "TODO" or "XXX" in the source.

  * Review the bug database at: http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/

  * Review the "PatchAvailable" bugs in the bug database:

    https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Apache+httpd-2&keywords=PatchAvailable

    After testing, you can append a comment saying "Reviewed and tested".

  * Open bugs in the bug database.

  * See also the STATUS file in the docs/ directory, which lists documentation-specific TODO items.


CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.4.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur after 2.4.1.  Such changes can
    only be made in the trunk.

  * All commits to branches/2.4.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk
    then merge into branches/2.4.x, as applicable.

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

   * mod_ssl: Add support for Next Protocol Negotiation.
     Trunk patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1332643
     2.4.x patch:
       Trunk patch works.
     +1: ben
     sf says: Needs r1345599, too.
              And wrowe's comment about the 2.2 patch is also valid for 2.4:
              http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1354823

   * mod_ssl: Add RFC 5878 support. This allows support of mechansisms
              such as Certificate Transparency. Note that new
              mechanisms are supported without software updates.
     trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1352596
     2.4.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~ben/httpd-2.4-rfc5878.patch
     +1: ben, druggeri
     -1: kbrand
     druggeri note: Needs docs for new directive
     kbrand: depends on an unreleased OpenSSL version (1.0.2), and
             RFC 5878 is of "Category: Experimental". Seems premature
             to me to consider for backporting to 2.4/2.2 at this point.
             The API in the OpenSSL implementation from May 2012
             (http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=22601) only covers the
             privately-defined TLSEXT_AUTHZDATAFORMAT_audit_proof, there's
             no support for x509_attr_cert (section 3.3.1 in RFC 5878) or
             saml_assertion (3.3.2). SSL_CTX_use_authz_file doesn't have
             any docs in OpenSSL, either, and there's no "openssl foo ..."
             command or similar to create/manage such files. Trunk is
             the right place where it can grow.
             Finally, httpd-2.4-rfc5878.patch includes a build-system change
             which is unrelated to this feature (see separate proposal from
             rjung below, ssl-support-uninstalled-openssl-2_4.patch).
     ben: not correct that it depends on OpenSSL 1.0.2, it builds with
          any version. Also, if you read my note to dev@ you will see
          why it is not premature.
     minfrin: once this gets docs, +1.

   * mod_slotmem_*: Add in new fgrab() function which forces a grab and
     slot allocation on a specified slot. Allow for clearing of inuse
     array.

      2.4.x patch: trunk patch works
     +1: jim, rjung

   * mod_proxy: Persist balancer and worker data across restarts and stop/start.
                NOTE: Assumes mod_slotmem patch which adds fgrab()

     2.4.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~jim/patches/proxy-persist2.diff
     +1: jim

   * mod_proxy: Allow balancers to be server-specific, as they should have
     been. Inheritance causes too many behind-the-scene interactions
     to be reliable in a dynamic environ. We maintain the old-default
     of inheritance.

     2.4.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~jim/patches/proxypassinherit.patch
     +1: jim, druggeri

   * mod_auth_form: Make sure that get_notes_auth() sets the user as does
     get_form_auth() and get_session_auth(). Makes sure that REMOTE_USER
     does not vanish during mod_include driven subrequests.

     * (3/x) various. Backport some easy patches to keep 2.4.x as much as
     possible in line with trunk.
        1407459: remove warnings
        1407460: remove warnings
        1419781: Use 'apr_is_empty_table()' instead of testing against 'apr_table_elts(...)->nelts'
        1418524: Use ap_rputs instead of ap_rvputs where applicable.
        1401448 & 1405407: just add a comment
        1405973: kill two warnings about incorrect printf parameters.
        1419726: cppCheck: same expression on both side of '|'.
                 Fix it the same way other messages are managed in the function.
        1418769: Fix a few 'too many arguments for format' warnings

OTHER PROPOSALS

   * opinion on more complete DefaultRuntimeDir use in 2.4.x?
     o If a module has a config directive for the run-time file that
       treats the configured path as relative to server root, preserve
       that behavior but change the location when not configured to
       respect DefaultRuntimeDir.  With these changes, users with no
       per-runtime-file configuration directives can control
       everything with DefaultRuntimeDir.
       BUT: Existing users of DefaultRuntimeDir might get a short-term scare
       when some unconfigured run-time file starts respecting their
       DefaultRuntimeDir directive after an upgrade.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

  * cross-compile: allow to provide CC_FOR_BUILD so that gen_test_char will be
    compiled by the build compiler instead of the host compiler.
    Also set CC_FOR_BUILD to 'cc' when cross-compilation is detected.

    2.4 patch: http://people.apache.org/~fuankg/diffs/httpd-2.4.x-cross_compile.diff
    fuankg: on hold until we agree for a better and more simple solution ...

   * mod_lua: Add a new directive, LuaCodeCache, for controlling the in-memory
              caching of scripts

     2.4.x patch: Trunk patch works
     +1: humbedooh, rjung
     rjung: docs missing?
     humbedooh: It's in the 2.4 docs already, but commented out, as with a lot
                of other functions that were never actually made. It's a mess ;)
     -1: sf
     sf: * If you copy'n'paste code, you need to assign new APLOGNOs.
           See r1383013 and docs/log-message-tags/README.
         * The code did not compile without warning, see r1383022.
         * If you have a request_rec, use ap_log_rerror to get the most
           specific log config. ap_log_perror always uses the global server
           log config.
         * Now that you have the request pool, don't you want to use it for
           the apr_stat() call instead of lifecycle_pool?
         * Try to not introduce new coding style issues. See r1383024,
           r1383028, r1383037.
