CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
      that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
      made in the trunk.

    * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
      as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
      get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
      branches/2.2.x, as applicable.

RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

   * Proxy does not allow any more connections to a server when a server
     is unavailable temporarily.
     Message-ID: <31C9151F757B06E7A3956FD1@st-augustin.local>
     Justin says: Yes, it's not a regression; but doing a release without
                  this fixed is pretty stupid.
     Ruediger says: It would be nice to make the worker retry a configurable
                    number of times, but as this problem can be mitigated by
                    setting Retry to 1 for this worker I do not regard this
                    as a showstopper. Furthermore I am open to change the
                    default value for retry (PROXY_WORKER_DEFAULT_RETRY) from
                    60 secs to 1 sec.

   * mod_cache: Fix PR38017 (mod_cache not working in reverse proxy setup?)
     Ruediger says: This is a regression against 2.0.x and makes it
                    impossible to use mod_cache on reverse proxies.

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:

    * mod_dbd: When threaded, create a private pool in child_init
      so we're not using the process pool later.  Also improve
      configuration defaults and merge function.
      (this assumes Colm's windows-build fixes are also backported)

    * Backport mod_authz_dbd (it's had some testing now)
      http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd/httpd/trunk/modules/aaa/mod_authz_dbd.c
      +1 niq

    * mod_proxy: Correctly error out if we get an error from upstream
      response.  Otherwise, we'll leave the client in a bad state.

      rpluem says: The patch mentioned above had been vetoed by Roy on the list
                   (http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/200512.mbox/ajax/%3cA1E95672-E36F-40FB-B906-41A447D72504@gbiv.com%3e)
                   Several changes have been done to this patch to fix the
                   problem and to address Roys veto (see also
                   http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/200601.mbox/%3c43BF83EB.8090703@apache.org%3e)
                   The patch now consists of the following revisions on

                   As it is fundamentally different from the first approach I
                   would suggest to restart the voting.
