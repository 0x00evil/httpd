RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

WIN32 1.3.1 RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * can not build tarball until someone verifies the final code
      will build on win32.  Want to avoid changes-after-tag that 
      happened with 1.3.0.

Documentation that needs writing:

    * Need a document explaining mod_rewrite/"UseCanonicalName off" based
      virtualhosting.  (If it exists already I can't find it easily.)
      => It still doesn't exists but I've already assembled the relevant
         information and config snippets. We just have to write a vhost-xxx.html
         document out of it. -- rse

Available Patches:

    * Bill Stoddard's [PATCH] PR2356 - SSI exec 
      This is an update of a patch I sent in earlier.  There are 13 new
      lines of code to detect and handle shellcmd.  COMMAND.COM is used
      to exec the script on Win95, CMD.EXE on NT.

    * "[PATCH] Link DSO modules against possible libraries from $(LIBS)"
      In the configuration process we already determine the variable LDFLAGS
      and LIBS. They hold -L and -l options for linking executables.  We parse
      these options and separate them into three classes: OBJ, PIC and DSO.
      And then we re-assemble a LIBS_SHLIB variable from only the options in
      classes PIC and DSO. This variable is then used on the build command for
      mod_xxx.so.

    * PR#2483 reports that RewriteMap program still don't work under Win32
      because of a SIGSEGV. The reporter is right, ap_spawn_child_core()
      calls the child function with NULL while in the child function the
      file handles have to be available. I've assembled the above patch
      from the reporters description/patch for testing by our Win32 folks.
      (I cannot test it myself).

    * Bill Stoddard's patch to make some structural changes to ap_call_exec to
      make it more readable and friendly to a couple of patches that will
      follow (capability to query the Win32 registry for interpreter name
      and a fix for mod_include exec=cmd processing). This patch does not
      change the function of ap_call_exec.

    * Paul's patch to add integrated restart/shutdown signalling (Win32)
      This patch make Apache listen on predictable event names to allow
      restarts and shutdowns to be initiated. Also adds a new command line
      option to send the shutdown or restart signal to the running parent 
      process.

    * Martin's patch to use the Basic Authentication scheme for (proxy-)
      ftp logins as well. When no password is given, but the ftp server
      requires one, a [401 Auth Required] response is generated on-the-fly.
      See: <19980716012456.04088@deejai.mch.sni.de>

In progress:
 
    * Ken's IndexFormat enhancement to mod_autoindex to allow
      CustomLog-like tailoring of directory listing formats

Needs patch:

    * Ralf: mod_so doesn't correctly initialise modules. For instance
      the handlers of mod_perl are not initialised. 
      An ap_init_modules() could be done from mod_so but this is too much.

      I've already debugged this up to ap_invoke_handler() and it correctly
      sees the handlers from mod_perl ("perl-script") and actually runs them.
      But under DSO situation it returns DECLINED while under non-DSO
      situation it runs fine. Sure, its mod_perl's fault because its mod_perl
      code which returns DECLINED.  But it definitely seems to be caused by a
      missing init in mod_so under DSO situation. I've already asked Doug for
      hints but he has not had a chance to look into it.

      Currently at least mod_perl is broken under the DSO situation because of
      this missing init in mod_so. But perhaps there are more modules which
      have the same problem. This should be fixed for 1.3.1 or at least found
      out why it is happening!

    * get_path_info bug; ap_get_remote_host should be ap_vformatter instead.
      See: <Pine.LNX.3.96dg4.980427034301.16648P-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>

    * uri issues
	- RFC2068 requires a server to recognize its own IP addr(s) in dot
	notation, we do this fine if the user follows the dns-caveats
	documentation... we should handle it in the case the user doesn't ever
	supply a dot-notation address.

    * Amdalh UTS 2.1.2
	Message-Id: <9801211635.ZM7239@ihgp1.ih.lucent.com>
	Message-Id: <199801220935.BAA13813@tiber.cisco.com>
	Jim: Sounded like the version of the OS that required
	     the patches were WAY old and would bugger the newer
	     versions... Not sure if we want to do that.

    * Problems dealing with .-rooted domain names such as "twinlark." versus
	"twinlark.arctic.org.".  See the thread containing
	Message-ID: <19980203211817.06723@deejai.mch.sni.de> for more details.
	In particular this affects the correctness of the proxy and the
	vhost mechanism.

    * PR#1799: we need to add a "default" or "none" handler to deal with
	filenames such as foo.map.gif which aren't image maps, and shouldn't
	be considered such.  See discussion in

    * proxy_*_canon routines use r->proxyreq incorrectly.  See

Open issues:

    * Underscores on symbols in DSO situation is broken for NetBSD:
      Here is a private conversation between me (rse) and Charles Hannum of
      the NetBSD project:

      From: "Charles M. Hannum" <mycroft@netbsd.org>
      > We have a bug report at the Apache BugDB (see
      > http://bugs.apache.org/private/index/full/2462) where a user says
      > under a particular NetBSD platform (NetBSD/pmax 1.3.2) the symbols on
      > dlsym() don't need an underscore.  In FreeBSD world we always had the
      > underscore,
      > [...]                               
      This is less an issue of OS, and more an issue of a.out vs. ELF.  The
      underscores are always used for a.out, and are never used for ELF.
      Therefore, on any platform where we use ELF (that would be Alpha, MIPS,
      PowerPC and UltraSPARC currently, although there are plans to eventually
      switch on other platforms), the underscores should not be added, and on
      all other platforms they should be.
      You can differentiate by comparing the output of `uname -m' with any
      of: alpha bebox macppc newsmips ofppc pica pmax sparc64.

    * How should an Apache binary release tarball look?
      NOTE: This should be resolved before 1.3.1 !!

      1. The "old" way where it is just a source release tarball
         plus a pre-compiled src/httpd-<gnutriple>. It is created
         via the apache-devsite/binbuild.sh script which
         - creates the build tree
         - creates the src/Configuration file with standard modules
         - runs "make"
         - renames src/httpd to src/httpd-<gnutriple>
         - runs "make clean"
         - packs the build tree stuff together
         Already known discussion points:
         - should src/httpd be renamed or now because a lot
           of PRs say they cannot find the httpd :-(
         Pros: <gets filled tomorrow>
         Cons: <gets filled tomorrow>
         Status: Ralf -0, Ken +0

      2. The way other projects release binary tarballs, i.e.
         a package containing the installed (binary) files.
         It can be created by a script which
         - creates the build tree
         - runs "./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache \
                             --enable-shared=remain \
                             --disable-module=auth_db \
                             --enable-suexec ..."
         - runs "make install root=apache-root"
         - packs the stuff together from ./apache-root only!!
         Already known discussion points:
         - should there be a prefix usr/local/apache in 
           the tarball or not?  Some people think
           it's useful while others dislike it a lot.
	 - it doesn't include the source.
	 - should suexec be prebuilt in a binary tarball?
         Pros: <gets filled tomorrow>
         Cons: <gets filled tomorrow>
         Status: Ralf +1, Martin +1, Ken -1 (not a veto)

    * Redefine APACHE_RELEASE. Add another 'bit' to signify whether
      it's a beta or final release. Maybe 'MMNNFFRBB' which means:
        MM: Major release #
	NN: Minor release #
	FF: "fix" level
	R:  0 if beta, 1 if final release
	BB: beta number

      See: <199806071444.KAA23147@devsys.jaguNET.com>
      Status: Jim +1, Ben +1, Martin +1

    * Someone other than Dean has to do a security/correctness review on
      psprintf(), bprintf(), and ap_snprintf().  In particular these routines
      do lots of fun pointer manipulations and such and possibly have overflow
      errors.  The respective flush_funcs also need to be exercised.
       o Jim's looked over the ap_snprintf() stuff (the changes that Dean
         did to make thread-safe) and they look fine.
       o Laura La Gassa's looked over ap_vformatter & other related code
       o Martin did a "source review" as well.
       o Could still use 1 or 2 more sets of eyeballs.
       Status: Is this still valid??

    * Paul would like to see a 'gdbm' option because he uses
      it a lot.

    * Maybe a http_paths.h file? See

	+1: Brian, Paul, Ralf, Martin
	+0: Jim (not for 1.3.0)

    * Release builds: Should we provide Configuration or not?
      Should we 'make all suexec' in src/support?
	+1: Brian, Jim, Ken +1 (possible suexec path issue, though)

    * root's environment is inherited by the Apache server. Jim & Ken
      think we should recommend using 'env' to build the
      appropriate environment. Marc and Alexei don't see any
      big deal. Martin says that not every "env" has a -u flag.

    * Marc's socket options like source routing (kill them?)
	Marc, Martin say Yes

    * Ken's PR#1053: an error when accessing a negotiated document
      explicitly names the variant selected.  Should it do so, or should
      the original URI be referenced?

    * Proposed API Changes:

	- r->content_language is for backwards compatibility... with modules
	  that may not link any longer without some minor editing.  The new
	  field is r->content_languages.  Heck it's not even mentioned in
	  apache-devsite/mmn.txt when we got content_languages (note the s!).
	  The proposal is to remove r->content_language:
	    Status: Paul +1, Ralf +1, Ken +1

	- child_exit() is redundant, it can be implemented via cleanups.  It is
	  not "symmetric" in the sense that there is no exit API method to go
	  along with the init() API method.  There is no need for an exit
	  method, there are already modules using cleanups to perform this (see
	  mod_mmap_static, and mod_php3 for example).  The proposal is to
	  remove the child_exit() method and document cleanups as the method of
	  handling this need.
	    Status: Rasmus +1, Paul +1, Jim +1, 
	            Martin +1, Ralf +1, Ken +1

    * Should we re-enable nagle now that we're non-buffering CGIs?  See
      various messages from Marc in March 98.
  
Win32 specific issues:

 In progress:

    * Martin's busy adding Via: support to the proby

      status/management.

	Status: Ken +1, Sameer +1, Martin +1, Ben +1 (as long as
	we get a single executable)

	Ken: What's W95-specific about it?

 Help:

    * "Directory /", "Directory C:/" both fail to do anything, 
      while "Directory *" SEGVs.

    * chdir() for CGI scripts and mod_include #exec needs to be 
      re-implemented now that CreateProcess is being used.

    * process/thread model
	- need dynamic thread creation/destruction, similar to 
	  Unix process model
	- can't use WaitForMultipleObjects in the same way we
	  do now, since that has a limit of 64(!) objects.  Grr.
	  PR#1665

    * some errors printed by CGIs to stderr don't end up making it
      to the server log unless an extra debugging message is added
      after they run? (PR#1725 indicates this may not be just Win32)

    * handle bugs that make it pop up errors on console, ie. segv 
      equiv?  Can we do this?  Need to make it robust.

    * install
	- make installshield work
	- config in cvs tree?
	- install docs, etc.?
	- location for install

    * the mutex should be critical-regions, since the current design
      is creating a mess of SO calls that are unnecessary

    * we don't mmap on NT.  Use TransmitFile?

    * CGIs
	- docs on how they work w/scripts
	- use registry to find interpreter?
	- WTF is the buffering coming from?
	    - we don't have a way to make non-blocking files on NT!

    * performance

    * documentation:
	- running the server without admin
	- how CGIs work
	- update README.NT
	- short/long name handling
	- better status page on current state of NT for users

    * http_main.c hell
	- split into two files?

    * who should run the service?  Who exactly is the "system account"?

      docs say:

      Localsystem is a very privileged account locally, so you shouldn't run
      any shareware applications there. However, it has no network privileges
      and cannot leave the machine via any NT-secured mechanism, including
      file system, named pipes, DCOM, or secure RPC.

      and:

      A service that runs in the context of the LocalSystem account
      inherits the security context of the SCM. It is not associated with
      any logged-on user account and does not have credentials (domain
      name, user name, and password) to be used for verification. This
      has several implications: [... removed ...]


      That _really_ sucks.  Can we recommend running Apache as some 
      other user?

    * need a crypt() of some sort.
	- sources are easy; problem is export restrictions on DES
	- if we don't do DES, can do md5

    * modules that need to be made to work on win32
        - mod_example isn't multithreadreded
	- mod_unique_id (needs mt changes)
	- mod_auth_db.c  (do we want to even try this?  We should have some
          db of some sort... what else can we pick from under win32?)
	- mod_auth_dbm.c
	- mod_info.c (PR re exporting symbols for it...)
	- mod_log_agent.c
	- mod_log_referer.c
	- mod_mime_magic.c (needs access to mod_mime API stage...)

    * do something to disable bogus warnings

    * rfc1413.c has static storage which won't work multithreaded

    * mod_include --> exec cgi, exec cmd, etc. don't work right.
      Looks like a code path that isn't run anywhere else that has
      something not quite right...  A PR or two on it.

    * signal type handling
    	- how to rotate logs from command line?

    * Currently if you double click on the conf files or the
      log files you get a useless dialog offering the set of all
      execuables, usually after a very long pause.  Ought
      to stuff .conf in the registry mapping it to text.

    * apparently either "BrowserMatch" or the "nokeepalive" variable
      cause instability - see PR#1729.

Delayed until after 1.3.0, unless someone happens to get to it:

    * Arnt Gulbrandsen <agulbra@troll.no> 03 Apr 1998 21:28:17 +0200
      <m3emzer9gu.fsf@lupinella.troll.no> mod_usertrack.c patch:
      The patch provides per-domain cookies (which I use to share user-ids
      among the *.troll.no web servers) and configurable cookie names.  It
      also marginally increases the efficiency of Apache when the server
      runs with DNS lookups turned off.

      Update: Dean found one part of the patch unacceptable, Arnt is in
        the process of updating it.  

    * TZ should not be dealt with specially any longer now that we have
      "PassEnv".  See
      <Pine.LNX.3.96dg4.980309224241.11283X-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>
       Jim: IMO it's too late in the game for this... I'm
            sure this would cause some strange bug reports as
	    people's cgi-scripts no longer work correctly
	    ("It worked just fine before I upgraded to 1.3.0")
	    unless we warn people in big nasty letters to add
	    PassEnv TZ to their config files "just in case"
	    and hope they do it :)

    * proxy module doesn't load on Win95.  Why?  Good question.
	PR#1462.

    * In ap_bclose() there's no test that (fb->fd != -1) -- so it's
      possible that it'll do something completely bogus when it's 
      used for read-only things. - Dean Gaudet

    * ap_pcfg_openfile doesn't use pfopen() to open the file.  Consider
     .htaccess parsing, if a timeout occurs the file may not be closed.  I
     can't imagine that a timeout would be set during this stage... but it'd
     probably be good to just clean this up. - Dean Gaudet

    * Okay, so our negotiation strategy needs a bit of refinement.  See
      <Pine.LNX.3.96dg4.980429182338.15569d-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>.
      In general, we need to go through and clean up the negotiation
      module to make it compliant with the final HTTP/1.1 draft, and at the
      very least we should make it more copacetic to the idea of transferring
      gzipped variants of files when both variants exist on the server.

    * Roy's HTTP/1.1 Wishlist items:
        1) New status codes?
        2) Expect
        3) byte range error handling
        4) update the Accept-Encoding parser to allow q-values
        5) would be nice if the proxy used Via, even as
	   HTTP/1.0

    * #ifdef __EMX__ --> #ifdef OS2.

    * use of spawnvp in uncompress_child in mod_mime_magic - doesn't
      use the new child_info structure, is this still safe?  Needs to be 
      looked at.

    * suexec doesn't understand argv parameters; e.g.

        <!--#exec cmd="./ls -l" -->

      fails even when "ls" is in the same directory because suexec is trying
      to stat a file called "ls -l".  A patch for this is available at

        http://www.xnet.com/~emarshal/suexec.diff

      and it's not bad except that it doesn't handle programs with spaces in
      the filename (think win32, or samba-mounted filesystems).  There are
      several PR's to this and I don't see for security reasons why we can't
      accomodate it, though it does add complexity to suexec.c.
