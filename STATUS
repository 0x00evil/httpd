               or not a patch will be made available.

UNADDRESSED ISSUES:

   *) mod_rewrite on Win32: change the mutex mechanism for RewriteLog
      to something more reliable; Apache on Win32 will often exit(1)
      currently if RewriteLog is enabled
      Patch is here:

        Subject: [1.3 PATCH] Win32 RewriteLog deadlock
      +1: trawick, wrowe, colm (tested on XP and Vista, but not 9x).

   *) mod_log_config: Cleanup log_header_out function to allow multiple headers
      like Set-Cookie to be logged properly. PR 27787 
        http://people.apache.org/~colm/mod_log_config.diff
      jerenkrantz asks: Isn't this what apr_table_merge is for?
      nd replies: yep. But cookies won't be merged, because browsers don't
                  support it.
      jerenkrantz: Couldn't we copy the table and merge the values somehow?
                   This just seems like a lot of code to duplicate what we
                   have already.  *shrug*

   * Current vote on 3 PRs for inclusion:

    * Dean's "unescaping hell" (unescaping the various URI components
      at the right time and place, esp. unescaping the host name).

        Status:

    * Martin observed a core dump because a ipaddr_chain struct contains
      a NULL-"server" pointer when being dereferenced by invoking "httpd -S".
        Message-ID: <20010213231854.A20932@deejai2.mch.fsc.net>
        Status: Workaround enabled. Clean solution can come after 1.3.19

    * long pathnames with many components and no AllowOverride None
      Workaround is to define <Directory /> with AllowOverride None,
      which is something all sites should do in any case.
	Status: Marc was looking at it.  (Will asks 'wasn't this patched?')

    * Ronald Tschalär's patch to mod_proxy to allow other modules to
      set headers too (needed by mod_auth_digest)
        Message-ID: <199907080712.JAA28269@chill.innovation.ch>
        Status:


Available Patches (Most likely, will be ported to 2.0 as appropriate):

   *  A rewrite of ap_unparse_uri_components() by Jeffrey W. Baker
     <jwbaker@acm.org> to more fully close some segfault potential.
        Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0102102350060.6815-200000@desktop>
        Status:  Jim +1 (for 1.3.19), Martin +0

    * Andrew Ford's patch (1999/12/05) to add absolute times to mod_expires
	Message-ID: <m3wvqtcoqx.fsf@icarus.demon.co.uk>
	Status: Martin +1, Jim +1, Ken +1 (on concept)

    * Raymond S Brand's path to mod_autoindex to fix the header/readme
      include processing so the envariables are correct for the included
      documents.  (Actually, there are two variants in the patch message,
      for two different ways of doing it.)
	Message-ID: <384AA242.B93F8B5@rsbx.net>
	Status: Martin +1(concept)

    * Jayaram's patch (10/27/99) for bugfix to mod_autoindex
      IndexIgnore <file-extension> should hide the files with this file-
      extension in directory listings. This was NOT happening because the 
      total filename was being compared with the file-extension.
      Status: Martin +1(untested), Ken +1(untested)
       
    * Salvador Ortiz Garcia <sog@msg.com.mx>' patch to allow DirectoryIndex
      to refer to URIs for non-static resources.

	Status: Lars +1 (on concept), Ken +1 (on concept),
                Martin +1(untested)

    * Aidan Cully's patch to allow assignment of 'ownership' of resources
      to either the server UID or the file's owner.
	Message-ID: <37306CB4.8EA9D76C@Golux.Com>
	Status: Ken +1, Dean +1, Randy +1, Lars +0, Jim +1

In progress:

Needs patch:

    * get_path_info bug; ap_get_remote_host should be ap_vformatter instead.
      See: <Pine.LNX.3.96dg4.980427034301.16648P-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>

    * URI issues
	- RFC2068 requires a server to recognize its own IP addr(s) in
	dot notation, we do this fine if the user follows the
	dns-caveats documentation... we should handle it in the case
	the user doesn't ever supply a dot-notation address.

    * Problems dealing with .-rooted domain names such as "twinlark."
        versus "twinlark.arctic.org.".  See the thread containing
	Message-ID: <19980203211817.06723@deejai.mch.sni.de> for more
	details.  In particular this affects the correctness of the
	proxy and the vhost mechanism.

    * proxy_*_canon routines use r->proxyreq incorrectly.  See
	<Pine.LNX.3.96dg4.980304030057.13656O-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>

Open issues:

    * Should we provide a way to force CustomError responses past IE's
      'prettify-if-less-than-N-bytes' bogosity?

    * general/3787: SERVER_PORT is always 80 if client comes to any port
      => needs review by the protocol guys, I think.

    * All DBMs suffer from confusion in dbmmanage (perl script) since the
        dbmmanage creates in the first-matched dbm format.  This is not
        necessarily the library that Apache was built with.  Aught to
        rewrite dbmmanage with the proper library for clean administration.

    * Marc's socket options like source routing (kill them?)
	Marc, Martin say Yes

    * In ap_bclose() there's no test that (fb->fd != -1) -- so it's
      possible that it'll do something completely bogus when it's 
      used for read-only things. - Dean Gaudet

    * Roy's HTTP/1.1 Wishlist items:
        1) byte range error handling

    * use of spawnvp in uncompress_child in mod_mime_magic - doesn't
      use the new child_info structure, is this still safe?  Needs to be 
      looked at.

    * suexec doesn't understand argv parameters; e.g.

        <!--#exec cmd="./ls -l" -->

      fails even when "ls" is in the same directory because suexec is trying
      to stat a file called "ls -l".  A patch for this is available at

        http://www.xnet.com/~emarshal/suexec.diff

      and it's not bad except that it doesn't handle programs with spaces in
      the filename (think win32, or samba-mounted filesystems).  There are
      several PR's to this and I don't see for security reasons why we can't
      accomodate it, though it does add complexity to suexec.c.
      Accepting quoted executable names solves that issue, except that the
      exec cmd="" parsing needs to accept escaped quotes.
      PR #1120
      Brian: +1
        Status: Already resolved in Apache 2.0 - exec is defined as passing
                the cmd="" argument as argv[0], which means it is -only- the
                file name to execute (with spaces allowed in the name.)
      
Win32/Netware specific issues:

    * mod_rewrite's cache isn't threadsafe, needs a mutex on Win32/Netware
      (and OS/2?)

    * apparently either "BrowserMatch" or the "nokeepalive" variable
      cause instability - see PR#1729.
