CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
      that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
      made in the trunk.

    * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
      as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
      get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
      branches/2.2.x, as applicable.

PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:

    * ApacheMonitor: Fix Windows Vista detection.
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=536052
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=556879
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=557188      
      +1: mturk
      wrowe notes post today to list, can we please test for >= VISTA
      so this doesn't break again upon the release of longhorn server
      or 'nextgen' windows?
      mturk notes: Simplified OS detection so any NT version will work
 
    * mpm_winnt: Fix return values from wait_for_many_objects.
      Note - this is required to avoid hangups of socket #64, #128
      as Microsoft set aside 64 reserved values.
      Trunk version of patch:
        http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=428029
      2.2.x version of patch:
        Trunk version works
        http://people.apache.org/~wrowe/mpm_winnt_waits.patch
        is easier to read (-U8)
      +1: mturk
      +0: fielding (patch is okay, underlying code is crap)
      wrowe notes: a patch should have the necessary effect with the
        minimum lines of code - there's alot of redecorating that's
        going on in this patch to no net effect.  The WAIT_TIMEOUT
        result value seems to be ignored in the revised code?
      mturk notes: WAIT_TIMEOUT is replaced by WAIT_FAILED with
        the accompanied patch in mpm\winnt\child.c.
      fielding notes: the routine is brain-dead -- one cannot replicate
        a wait for many objects by iterating through multiple waits with
        a one second sleep in between loops.  That's insane.
        The right ways to do that are explained in the MSDN article
        <http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms687025.aspx>
        In any case, it should be checking nCount <= MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS
        first and use the simple wait in that case.
      mturk notes: We are interested in that only during shutdown
        so a one second simplification is acceptable compromise.
        The sole purpose of the patch is to allow the clean shutdown
        when the MaxClients is higher then 257. 

   * mod_authn_dbd: Export any additional columns queried in the SQL select
     into the environment with the name AUTHENTICATE_<COLUMN>. This brings
     mod_authn_dbd behaviour in line with mod_authnz_ldap.
     Trunk: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=466865
     +1: minfrin
     niq: This wants a little tidying.  Use of 13 as a magic number (for a
          strlen of something defined elsewhere) is nasty.  More importantly
          you need to document how it affects the module's directives.
          I'll +1 it when that's done.
     wrowe: ditto's - good concept.

   * mod_dbd: initialise resources and prepared statements in all vhosts
     PRs: 42327, 41302
     Trunk: N/A due to other changes (r503931 et al)
     Patch by bojan: http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=20161
     +1: niq
     -1: chrisd: I think r503931 is actually the right thing to backport here,
         which admittedly probably requires backporting r491729, r491884,
         r492394 (trivial), and r496831 first.  While more complex than a
         quick patch, I think the explanation in the fourth section of this
         post explains why there's no simple fix for the virtual-host
         inheritance issues:

         http://marc.info/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=116742014418304&w=2

         Doing this work would also let us close at least three PRs.
         PR 42327 seems like a duplicate of 41302 (both would be closed
         by r503931), and r496831 would close PR 39985 as well.

   * mod_dbd: Rename functions and variables for consistency, and move
     some functions around for readability, prior to making
     functional changes for PRs 39985, 41302, and other issues.

     +1: chrisd, fuankg
     +1: niq (to chris's mod_dbd updates collectively)

   * mod_dbd: Handle error conditions in dbd_construct() properly.
     Simplify ap_dbd_open() and use correct arguments to apr_dbd_error()
     when non-threaded.  Register correct cleanup data in non-threaded
     ap_dbd_acquire() and ap_dbd_cacquire().  Clean up configuration data
     and merge function.  Use ap_log_error() wherever possible.

   * beos MPM: Create pmain pool and run modules' child_init hooks when
     entering ap_mpm_run(), then destroy pmain when exiting ap_mpm_run().
     Otherwise modules' child_init hooks appear to never be executed.
     Also, destroying pmain ensures that cleanups registered in modules'
     child_init hooks are performed (e.g., mod_log_config and mod_dbd).
     Trunk version of patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=491922
     2.2.x version of patch:

     +0: chrisd (abstaining; unable to test)

   * mod_dbd: Create memory sub-pools for each DB connection and close
     DB connections in a pool cleanup function.  Ensure prepared statements
     are destroyed before DB connection is closed.  When using reslists,
     prevent segfaults when child processes exit, and stop memory leakage
     of ap_dbd_t structures.  Avoid use of global s->process->pool, which
     isn't destroyed by exiting child processes in most multi-process MPMs.

     +1: chrisd
     +1: niq (to chris's mod_dbd updates collectively)

   * mod_dbd: Introduce configuration groups to allow inheritance by virtual
     hosts of database configurations from the main server.  Determine the
     minimal set of distinct configurations and share connection pools
     whenever possible.  Allow virtual hosts to override inherited SQL
     statements.  See also the fourth section of:
       http://marc.info/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=116742014418304&w=2
     and the eventual solution as implemented in the dbd_post_config()
     function.  Obviates r424798, r432560, r432562, and r466641.
     Could be improved by the addition of <DBDGroup> configuration
     sections.  (Any takers?  :-)

    * mod_proxy: Improve traces in ap_proxy_http_process_response()
      to investigate PR37770.

      +1: jfclere, mturk
      -0.5: rpluem says: As said in
       http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/200706.mbox/%3c46828E5A.50606@apache.org%3e
       I would prefer creating the brigade used in ap_proxygetline outside of
       the loop and pass it to ap_proxygetline for each call. Only do an
       apr_brigade_cleanup inside of ap_proxygetline then. Furthermore the
       check for a buffer overflow a few lines later is not correct any more
       (now an error (APR_ENOSPC) is returned instead).

    * mod_proxy_ajp: Add support of ProxyIOBufferSize.

    * mod_proxy: Enable ProxySet inside <Proxy> section to create balancer or
      worker if they were not already created. This allows to have ProxySet
      directive before BalancerMember directives inside Proxy section.

      -0.5: niq - This (ProxySet) needs documenting. 
            Reviewing it 'blind' lacks appeal.

    * mod_proxy: Allow optional name=value options within <Proxy section line.
      Additional arguments are allowed only for 'standard' url's, meaning that
      the wildchar urls will return error like before. This allow to specify
      the worker/balancer parameters on the definition line, without the need
      for extra ProxySet options.

    * mod_ldap, mod_authnzldap: Add support for nested groups (i.e. the ability
      to authorize an authenticated user via a "require ldap-group X" directive
      where the user is not in group X, but is in a subgroup contained in X.

      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=560373
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=562165
      A version of the patch specific to the 2.2 branch (i.e. the patch that
      would be used for backport) can be found at:
      http://people.apache.org/~rederpj/NestedGroups_2.2.xBranch.diff 
      +1: rederpj
      -0: bnicholes - Unless this is considered to be a significant deficiency in the
                       authnz_ldap 2.2 functionality, I would rather see this as new
		       functionality going forward in 2.4 rather than backported to
		       2.2. We need new functionality to push us forward rather than
		       give us an excuse to stay where we are.
      rederpj says: I'm working on a project based on Apache 2.2.x which needs this code
          and I would much prefer to use official Apache code than end up using a private
          patch. It isn't possible in the short term for us to move to trunk. It just
          happened that code I had written to add this function lined up with PR 42891.
          I was going to submit it and work to get it backported either way.
      rpluem says: I am still missing a minor bump due to the changes done
      in util_ldap.h. This is an extension of a public API.
      trawick says: The new directives should be documented in trunk,
          so that docs are available for backport at the same time.

          ProxyPassEnv* or ProxyPassSubstitute* directives that add this
          behavior on a pattern-by-pattern basis would win my -1 to a +1,
          and solve the performance hits noted by niq on an 80/20 basis.
