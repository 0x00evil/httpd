Contributors looking for a mission:

    * Just do an egrep on "TODO" or "XXX" in the source.

    * Review the bug database at: http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/

    * Review the "PatchAvailable" bugs in the bug database:

      http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Apache+httpd-2.0&keywords=PatchAvailable

      After testing, you can append a comment saying "Reviewed and tested".

CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
      that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
      made in the trunk.

    * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
      as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
      get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
      branches/2.2.x, as applicable.

RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

   * Proxy does not allow any more connections to a server when a server
     is unavailable temporarily.
     Message-ID: <31C9151F757B06E7A3956FD1@st-augustin.local>
     Justin says: Yes, it's not a regression; but doing a release without
                  this fixed is pretty stupid.

PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:

    * Backport Win32 build fixes for mod_dbd and mod_authn_dbd
        http://people.apache.org/~colm/httpd-2.2.0-dbd-win32.patch
      +1: colm, pquerna, niq

    * mod_proxy_balancer: Fix PR37753 (mod_proxy_balancer Stickysession that
      uses URL doesn't work)
      Trunk version of patch:
         http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=352010&view=rev
      Backport version for 2.2.x of patch:
         Trunk version of patch works
      +1: rpluem

    * core: Stop stripping C-L from HEAD responses which prevents use
      of Windows Update through mod_proxy amongst other things.
        http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=327008&view=rev
      PR: 18757
      +1: jorton
      +1: niq - this looks fine, but the comment about filters
                misses the fact that mod_filter's protocol handling
                gives us the 'long term' if we just use it.

    * mod_ssl/ab: Fix compiler warnings with OpenSSL 0.9.8a.
        http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=349415&view=rev
      +1: jorton

    * core: Die properly if an error occurs in post_read_request

      +1: niq

      http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=354118&view=rev
      PR: 36090
      +1: niq, rpluem

    * mod_dbd: When threaded, create a private pool in child_init
      so we're not using the process pool later.  Also improve
      configuration defaults and merge function.
      (this assumes Colm's windows-build fixes are also backported)

      +1 niq

    * mod_proxy: Correctly error out if we get an error from upstream

      http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=354628&view=rev
      http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=354636&view=rev (comment only delta)

      http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=350250&view=rev
      jerenkrantz: I don't like the fact that the if/else are doing the same
                   thing.
