RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * protocol/6973: http_protocol.c isn't compatible with HTTP RFC.
      Fix committed, waiting for OK from a user with problems.

RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * long pathnames with many components and no AllowOverride None
      Workaround is to define <Directory /> with AllowOverride None,
      which is something all sites should do in any case.
	Status: Marc was looking at it.

    * Ronald Tschalär's patch to mod_proxy to allow other modules to
      set headers too (needed by mod_auth_digest)
        Message-ID: <199907080712.JAA28269@chill.innovation.ch>
        Status:

Documentation that needs writing:


Available Patches (Most likely, these will not be added to the official
1.3 tree, but instead should be ported to 2.0):

    * Patch from "C. Bottelier" <c.bottelier@quicknet.nl> to run
	Apache without daemonizing the parent process. PR#7040
	Status: fanf +1 (except it needs docs)

    * Andrew Ford's patch (1999/12/05) to add absolute times to mod_expires
	Message-ID: <m3wvqtcoqx.fsf@icarus.demon.co.uk>
	Status: Martin +1, Jim +1, Ken +1 (on concept)

    * Raymond S Brand's path to mod_autoindex to fix the header/readme
      include processing so the envariables are correct for the included
      documents.  (Actually, there are two variants in the patch message,
      for two different ways of doing it.)
	Message-ID: <384AA242.B93F8B5@rsbx.net>
	Status: Martin +1(concept)

    * Jayaram's patch (10/27/99) for changes to mod_autoindex
 
	Problem 1:
	------------------------
	AddIcon (<alttext>,<icon>) ^^DIRECTORY^^ 
	and 
	AddIcon (<alttext>,<icon>) ^^BLANKICON^^ 
	should be able to set the alternate text and icon file for any
	directory/blankicon in a directory listing. This was not happening
	because the alternate text for ^^DIRECTORY^^ and ^^BLANKICON^^ were
	hardcoded to  "DIR" and "   " respectively.

	Problem 2:
	-------------------------
	IndexIgnore <file-extension> should hide the files with this file-
	extension in directory listings. This was NOT happening because the 
	total filename was being compared with the file-extension.

	Status: Martin +1(untested), Ken +1(untested)
       
    * Stipe Tolj's Cygwin32 port
        New Message-ID: <39F6BD04.7C8922B0@wapme-systems.de> for 1.3.14
	Original PR#: 2936
        Status: Lars +1 (on concept), Martin +1 (on concept), Ken +1 (concept),
                Jim +1 (concept)

    * Salvador Ortiz Garcia <sog@msg.com.mx>' patch to allow DirectoryIndex
      to refer to URIs for non-static resources.
	MID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.9906041415330.15776-100000@xiomara.msg.com.mx>
	Status: Ken +1 (on concept), Lars +1 (on concept)

    * Brian Havard's patch to remove dependency of mod_auth_dbm on mod_auth.
      (PR#2598)
	Message-ID: <199905170830.SAA31549@silk.apana.org.au>
	Status: Lars +1 (on concept), Ken +1 (on concept), Martin +1(untested)

    * Aidan Cully's patch to allow assignment of 'ownership' of resources
      to either the server UID or the file's owner.
	Message-ID: <37306CB4.8EA9D76C@Golux.Com>
	Status: Ken +1, Dean +1, Randy +1, Lars +0, Jim +1

In progress:

    * Doug MacEachern's libapr - Generic Apache Request Library (Alpha)
      This package contains modules for manipulating client request data
      via the Apache API with Perl and C.
        Status: http://perl.apache.org/dist/ (look for the latest libapr-* file)

    * David Harris' note of odd size memory allocations.  Dean notes
      that this is due to BLOCK_MIN_ALLOC.  Should we reduce it to 1024?
      Discussion in thread following message-ID below.
	Message-ID: <00a001bedc00$fbc5af60$0500a8c0@delf>
	Status: 

    * Martin Kraemer's mod_ebcdic.c: a new module which will contain the
      ebcdic related stuff (common to all ebcdic based os's) and will
      allow for flexible configuration of the conversion rules. That
      will replace the current hardwired heuristics.
	Message-Id: none yet
	Status: first prototype running, to be posted to list soon.

Needs patch:

    * MaxRequestsPerChild doesn't count requests, only the
      number of connections processed.
      We can either 'fix' it by renaming the directive to
      MaxConnectionsPerChild or really fix it to actually count
      the number of requests.
      Status: Will be fixed in 2.0

    * get_path_info bug; ap_get_remote_host should be ap_vformatter instead.
      See: <Pine.LNX.3.96dg4.980427034301.16648P-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>

    * URI issues
	- RFC2068 requires a server to recognize its own IP addr(s) in dot
	notation, we do this fine if the user follows the dns-caveats
	documentation... we should handle it in the case the user doesn't ever
	supply a dot-notation address.

    * Problems dealing with .-rooted domain names such as "twinlark." versus
	"twinlark.arctic.org.".  See the thread containing
	Message-ID: <19980203211817.06723@deejai.mch.sni.de> for more details.
	In particular this affects the correctness of the proxy and the
	vhost mechanism.

    * proxy_*_canon routines use r->proxyreq incorrectly.  See
	<Pine.LNX.3.96dg4.980304030057.13656O-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>

    * Should we disallow requests with bogus characters in the method?
      See <Pine.LNX.3.96dg4.990107093844.14158A-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>

Open issues:

    * Should we provide a way to force CustomError responses past IE's
      'prettify-if-less-than-N-bytes' bogosity?

    * there are still some PRs about inetd mode
      Should we deprecate "ServerType inetd" if the next release is 1.4.0?
        +1: Lars
	-0: Martin (ISTR someone volunteered to "keep it working". I fear
	    some exotic platforms may require it)

    * general/3787: SERVER_PORT is always 80 if client comes to any port
      => needs review by the protocol guys, I think.

    * All DBMs suffer from confusion in dbmmanage (perl script) since the
        dbmmanage creates in the first-matched dbm format.  This is not
        necessarily the library that Apache was built with.  Aught to
        rewrite dbmmanage with the proper library for clean administration.

    * SDBM is now distributed in src/lib, as distributed with mod_dav, but
      is only incorporated into the Win32 build.  Extra cleanup and build 
      mechanics are still needed for other platforms.

    * Release builds: Should we provide Configuration or not?
      Should we 'make all suexec' in src/support?
	+1: Brian, Jim, Dirkx, Ken +1 (possible suexec path issue, though)

    * root's environment is inherited by the Apache server. Jim & Ken
      think we should recommend using 'env' to build the
      appropriate environment. Marc and Alexei don't see any
      big deal. Martin says that not every "env" has a -u flag. 
      Also:  TZ should not be dealt with specially any longer now that we 
      "have PassEnv".  See
      <Pine.LNX.3.96dg4.980309224241.11283X-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>
      Status: To be handled in 2.0

    * Marc's socket options like source routing (kill them?)
	Marc, Martin say Yes

    * Proposed API Changes:

	- r->content_language is for backwards compatibility... with modules
	  that may not link any longer without some minor editing.  The new
	  field is r->content_languages.  Heck it's not even mentioned in
	  apache-devsite/mmn.txt when we got content_languages (note the s!).
	  The proposal is to remove r->content_language:
	    Status: Paul +1, Ralf +1, Ken +1, Martin +1, Dirkx +1 (I could
		not find ANY module which uses it and which (still) compiles
		after the config change.)

	- child_exit() is redundant, it can be implemented via cleanups.  It is
	  not "symmetric" in the sense that there is no exit API method to go
	  along with the init() API method.  There is no need for an exit
	  method, there are already modules using cleanups to perform this (see
	  mod_mmap_static, and mod_php3 for example).  The proposal is to
	  remove the child_exit() method and document cleanups as the method of
	  handling this need.
	    Status: Rasmus +1, Paul +1, Jim +1, 
	            Martin +1, Ralf +1, Ken +1, 
		    Dirkx +1 (with doc change)

    * Should we re-enable nagle now that we're non-buffering CGIs?  See
      various messages from Marc in March 98.
  
    * In ap_bclose() there's no test that (fb->fd != -1) -- so it's
      possible that it'll do something completely bogus when it's 
      used for read-only things. - Dean Gaudet

    * Roy's HTTP/1.1 Wishlist items:
        1) byte range error handling

    * use of spawnvp in uncompress_child in mod_mime_magic - doesn't
      use the new child_info structure, is this still safe?  Needs to be 
      looked at.

    * suexec doesn't understand argv parameters; e.g.

        <!--#exec cmd="./ls -l" -->

      fails even when "ls" is in the same directory because suexec is trying
      to stat a file called "ls -l".  A patch for this is available at

        http://www.xnet.com/~emarshal/suexec.diff

      and it's not bad except that it doesn't handle programs with spaces in
      the filename (think win32, or samba-mounted filesystems).  There are
      several PR's to this and I don't see for security reasons why we can't
      accomodate it, though it does add complexity to suexec.c.
      Accepting quoted executable names solves that issue.
      PR #1120
      Brian: +1
      
Win32 specific issues:

    * Some bug reports indicate that sdbm for mod_auth_dbm may be ignoring
      the first record.  gstein suggests this may have to do with page size
      configuration in our sdbm vs. perl's.

    * Adding a tray application to the Windoze version for ease of
      status/management.  (PR3594, PR4873)
        No one has implemented a pure C language WinAPI (no MFC) 
        multiple-services aware taskbar app for both WinNT and Win95,
        since multiple-services are recent and Win9x is even more
        recent.  Open to anyone proposing something complete.
        If it comes between releases, add it to contrib right away!
        See src/os/win32/monitoring-services.txt for details.
        Status: both Brian Moon and William Rowe are experimenting.

    * chdir() for CGI scripts and mod_include #exec needs to be 
      re-implemented now that CreateProcess is being used.

    * process/thread model
	- need dynamic thread creation/destruction, similar to 
	  Unix process model

    * handle bugs that make it pop up errors on console, ie. segv 
      equiv?  Can we do this?  Need to make it robust.
      This is done for mod_isapi by the ap_load_dso code on win32,
      look there for an example ... probably not appropriate everywhere,
      but only where the client is affecting the state of the machine.
      What the operator does is a different matter.

    * install
	- make installshield work
	- config in cvs tree?
	- install docs, etc.?
	- location for install

    * the mutex should be critical-regions, since the current design
      is creating a mess of SO calls that are unnecessary

    * performance

    * modules that need to be made to work on win32
        - mod_example isn't multithreadreded
	- mod_unique_id (needs mt changes, use win32 com UUID's)
	- mod_log_agent.c
	- mod_log_referer.c
	- mod_mime_magic.c (needs access to mod_mime API stage...)

    * do something to disable bogus warnings

    * rfc1413.c has static storage which won't work multithreaded

    * mod_include --> exec cgi, exec cmd, etc. don't work right.
      Looks like a code path that isn't run anywhere else that has
      something not quite right...  A PR or two on it.

    * Currently if you double click on the conf files or the
      log files you get a useless dialog offering the set of all
      executables, usually after a very long pause.  Ought
      to stuff .conf in the registry mapping it to text.

    * apparently either "BrowserMatch" or the "nokeepalive" variable
      cause instability - see PR#1729.
