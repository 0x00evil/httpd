Contributors looking for a mission:

    * Just do an egrep on "TODO" or "XXX" in the source.

    * Review the bug database at: http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/

    * Review the "PatchAvailable" bugs in the bug database:

      https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Apache+httpd-2&keywords=PatchAvailable

      After testing, you can append a comment saying "Reviewed and tested".

CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
      that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
      made in the trunk.

    * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
      as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
      get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
      branches/2.2.x, as applicable.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

   * Awaiting next apr-util release to address licensing concerns.

PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:

    * mod_dbd: When threaded, create a private pool in child_init
      so we're not using the process pool later.  Also improve
      configuration defaults and merge function.
      (this assumes Colm's windows-build fixes are also backported)
      http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=348026&view=rev
      http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=354400&view=rev
      +1 niq, trawick

    * Backport mod_authz_dbd (it's had some testing now)
      http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd/httpd/trunk/modules/aaa/mod_authz_dbd.c
      +1 niq
      -1 bnicholes - The authorization refactoring that was done is for 2.3 and above.
                     This can not be backported to 2.2.

    * mod_include:  APR_FILEPATH_NOTABOVEROOT was undefined with
      a left-hand NULL or empty path.  The SECUREROOTPATH and 
      NOTABSOLUTE tests are sufficient for this application.  
      Adjust for this bug in earlier versions of APR that mishandled
      the NOTABOVEROOT flag with an empty left hand value.
        http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=382147&view=rev

      headers)
      Trunk version of patch:
         http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=377053&view=rev
         http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=377057&view=rev

         Trunk version of patch works
      +1: rpluem, jim

    * mod_isapi: Trivial compiler emit fixes for const'ness - noticed on OS/X
      Correct lvalue assignments (lvalue casts not allowed) - noticed on Sol.
      Resolve use of SetLastError with apr_set_os_error() and axe MAKEFILE
      for a literal value.  Permits mod_isapi to load and run on Unix.

    * mod_proxy_ajp: Remove the Flushing Bandaid from compile time
      to a more admin-friendly runtime setting.
         http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=384580&view=rev

      -0: pquerna
      pquerna says: Why is this configuration for AJP polluting mod_proxy.h?
                    Shouldn't we be keeping the configuration of a Proxy Provider
                    separate from the main mod_proxy?
