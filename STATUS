Contributors looking for a mission:

    * Just do an egrep on "TODO" or "XXX" in the source.

    * Review the bug database at: http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/

    * Review the "PatchAvailable" bugs in the bug database:

      http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Apache+httpd-2.0&keywords=PatchAvailable

      After testing, you can append a comment saying "Reviewed and tested".

CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
      that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
      made in the trunk.

    * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
      as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
      get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
      branches/2.2.x, as applicable.

RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

   * Proxy does not allow any more connections to a server when a server
     is unavailable temporarily.
     Message-ID: <31C9151F757B06E7A3956FD1@st-augustin.local>
     Justin says: Yes, it's not a regression; but doing a release without
                  this fixed is pretty stupid.

      +1: jorton, jerenkrantz

    * mod_dbd: When threaded, create a private pool in child_init
      so we're not using the process pool later.  Also improve
      configuration defaults and merge function.
