CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.4.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur after 2.4.1.  Such changes can
    only be made in the trunk.

  * All commits to branches/2.4.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk
    then merge into branches/2.4.x, as applicable.

PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

   * mod_ssl: Add support for Next Protocol Negotiation.
     Trunk patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1332643
     2.4.x patch:
       Trunk patch works.
     +1: ben
     sf says: Needs r1345599, too.
              And wrowe's comment about the 2.2 patch is also valid for 2.4:
              http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1354823

   * mod_ssl: Add RFC 5878 support. This allows support of mechansisms
              such as Certificate Transparency. Note that new
              mechanisms are supported without software updates.
     trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1352596
     2.4.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~ben/httpd-2.4-rfc5878.patch
     +1: ben, druggeri
     druggeri note: Needs docs for new directive
     kbrand: depends on an unreleased OpenSSL version (1.0.2), and
             RFC 5878 is of "Category: Experimental". Seems premature
             to me to consider for backporting to 2.4/2.2 at this point.
     ben: not correct that it depends on OpenSSL 1.0.2, it builds with
          any version. Also, if you read my note to dev@ you will see
          why it is not premature.

   * mod_ssl: Add SSLCompression directive.
     trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1345319 and 
                  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1348656
     2.4.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/ssl-compression-directive-2_4.patch
     +1: rjung, sf

     for TLS, RFC 5054).

     rjung: sf: you applied it to trunk, care to vote?

   * mod_ssl: Pass the server_rec to ssl_die() and use it to log a message to
     the main error log, pointing to the appropriate virtual host error log.
     trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1348660
     2.4.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/ssl_die-improve_vhost-logging-2_4.patch

   * proxy_ajp: Use short lived pool to avoid memory leaks.
     Remove the comment about binding upstream and downstream connections. It
     seems to be obsolete since r104604, r104605, r105108.
     Also avoid allocating memory if we are not handling the connection.
