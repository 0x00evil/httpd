Contributors looking for a mission:

  * Just do an egrep on "TODO" or "XXX" in the source.

  * Review the bug database at: http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/

  * Review the "PatchAvailable" bugs in the bug database:

    https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Apache+httpd-2&keywords=PatchAvailable

    After testing, you can append a comment saying "Reviewed and tested".

  * Open bugs in the bug database.

  * See also the STATUS file in the docs/ directory, which lists documentation-specific TODO items.


CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.4.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur after 2.4.1.  Such changes can
    only be made in the trunk.

  * All commits to branches/2.4.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk
    then merge into branches/2.4.x, as applicable.

PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]



PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

   * mod_ssl: Add support for Next Protocol Negotiation.
     Trunk patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1332643
     2.4.x patch:
       Trunk patch works.
     +1: ben
     sf says: Needs r1345599, too.
              And wrowe's comment about the 2.2 patch is also valid for 2.4:
              http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1354823

   * mod_ssl: Add RFC 5878 support. This allows support of mechansisms
              such as Certificate Transparency. Note that new
              mechanisms are supported without software updates.
     trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1352596
     2.4.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~ben/httpd-2.4-rfc5878.patch
     +1: ben, druggeri
     druggeri note: Needs docs for new directive
     kbrand: depends on an unreleased OpenSSL version (1.0.2), and
             RFC 5878 is of "Category: Experimental". Seems premature
             to me to consider for backporting to 2.4/2.2 at this point.
     ben: not correct that it depends on OpenSSL 1.0.2, it builds with
          any version. Also, if you read my note to dev@ you will see
          why it is not premature.

   * mod_ssl: Add support for TLS-SRP (Secure Remote Password key exchange
     for TLS, RFC 5054).
     trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1347980 and 
                  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1348653
     2.4.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/ssl-TLS-SRP-2_4.patch
     +1: rjung, 
     rjung: sf: you applied it to trunk, care to vote?

   * mod_ssl: Work correctly with a development version of OpenSSL.
     trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1358167 and 
                  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1358168
     2.4.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/ssl-support-uninstalled-openssl-2_4.patch
     +1: 
     rjung: Revoked my vote due to ongoing discussion

   * mod_lua: Add a new directive, LuaCodeCache, for controlling the in-memory 
              caching of scripts
     trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1366890
                  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1367025

                  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1367042 (CHANGES)
     2.4.x patch: Trunk patch works (*provided the authz provider gets backported)
     +1: humbedooh, rjung
     rjung: docs missing?
     humbedooh: It's in the 2.4 docs already, but commented out, as with a lot 
                of other functions that were never actually made. It's a mess ;)

   * mod_cache: Wrong content type and character set when
     mod_cache serves stale content because of a proxy error.
     PR 53539. Correction to r1361153.

OTHER PROPOSALS

   * opinion on more complete DefaultRuntimeDir use in 2.4.x?
     o If a module has a config directive for the run-time file that
       treats the configured path as relative to server root, preserve
       that behavior but change the location when not configured to
       respect DefaultRuntimeDir.  With these changes, users with no 
       per-runtime-file configuration directives can control
       everything with DefaultRuntimeDir.
       BUT: Existing users of DefaultRuntimeDir might get a short-term scare
       when some unconfigured run-time file starts respecting their 
       DefaultRuntimeDir directive after an upgrade.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

  * cross-compile: allow to provide CC_FOR_BUILD so that gen_test_char will be
    compiled by the build compiler instead of the host compiler.
    Also set CC_FOR_BUILD to 'cc' when cross-compilation is detected.
