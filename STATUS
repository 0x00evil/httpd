CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
    made in the trunk.  Note 2.2.18 contained an incompatible ABI change,
    subsequently corrected, and should not be referenced.

  * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
    get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
    branches/2.2.x, as applicable.

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

  * mod_cache: Realign the cache_quick_handler() to behave identically
    to the default_handler() when reacting to errors when writing to the
    filter stack. Stops APR errors appearing in access_log as result codes.
    Trunk patches: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1003913
    2.2.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~minfrin/httpd-mod_cache-errorfix-22.patch

    trawick: any reason it shouldn't be completely aligned with default_handler's
             choice to return OK vs. 500?
    rpluem: Agreed with trawick. They should behave the same.

   * mod_ssl: Add support for Next Protocol Negotiation.
     Trunk patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1332643
     2.2.x patch:
       http://www.links.org/files/npn-patch-2.2.patch
     +1: benl
     sf notes: needs the buffer overflow fix from r1345599, too
     wrowe notes: also needs correction to
       ssl_engine_kernel.c: In function 'ssl_callback_AdvertiseNextProtos':
       ssl_engine_kernel.c:2140:5: warning: implicit declaration of function
                                   'modssl_run_npn_advertise_protos_hook'
                  Including mod_ssl.h after ssl_private.h seems to suffice. 
                  The change introduces hard linkages from modules into
                  mod_ssl.so (distinct from httpd), AP is the incorrect
                  namespace, see mod_dav main hooks as an example.
                  Prior to this patch all calls to mod_ssl were by way of
                  registered functions through apr bindings.  Seems there
                  aught to be a way to add an npn cooperating module when
                  mod_ssl is not loaded, but right now it would fail.
                  An mmn minor bump would also be required for API addition.

  * mod_cache: Allow providers to decide whether to cache responses with code
    206.

    Backport version for 2.2.x of the patches above:
      http://people.apache.org/~wrowe/tls11-12-patch-2.2-kbrand-wrowe.1.patch
    +1: wrowe, 
    kbrand: The #define HAVE_TLSV1_X stuff should go to ssl_toolkit_compat.h,
              [wrowe] disagree, since that API was deprecated 
                kbrand: ok, won't insist on that, but as long as 2.2 still
                        has ssl_toolkit_compat.h, I would prefer to see all
                        OpenSSL version number checking etc. in a single place
            patch .1 now has an issue with handling "SSLProtocol SSLv2"
            or "SSLProtocol +SSLv2" (which are pretty nonsensical settings,
            but nevertheless): ssl_cmd_protocol_parse will reject these
            with "SSLv2 not supported by this version of OpenSSL", even
            if OpenSSL hasn't been compiled with OPENSSL_NO_SSL2. I suggest
            to drop the #ifndef around SSL_PROTOCOL_SSLV2 in ssl_private.h,
            this should also make some of the other "#if[n]def OPENSSL_NO_SSL2"
            encapsulations unnecessary.
    sf:
        - ssl_engine_init.c: misses two "ctx = SSL_CTX_new(method);" calls
          (or move the existing ones after the if blocks).
            [wrowe] nice catch, later option is simpler, changed in patch .1
        - The handling of "SSLProtocol all -SSLv2" is broken,
          resulting in a "No SSL protocols available" error.
          This is due to the "thisopt = SSL_PROTOCOL_SSLV2" line being
          removed in the OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT case.
            [wrowe] fixed in patch .1 to gracefully accept -SSLv2

   * mod_ssl: Add RFC 5878 support. This allows support of mechanisms
              such as Certificate Transparency. Note that new
              mechanisms are supported without software updates.
     trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1352596
     2.2.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~ben/httpd-2.2-rfc5878.patch
     +1: ben, druggeri
     druggeri note: Needs docs for new directive
     kbrand: depends on an unreleased OpenSSL version (1.0.2), and
             RFC 5878 is of "Category: Experimental". Seems premature
             to me to consider for backporting to 2.4/2.2 at this point.
     ben: not correct that it depends on OpenSSL 1.0.2, it builds with
          any version. Also, if you read my note to dev@ you will see
          why it is not premature.

   * mod_ssl: When receiving http on https, send the error response with http 1.0
     It is important that we send a proper error status, or search engines
     may index the error message.

    -1: wrowe [This introduces new invalid paths which do not resolve to any
               configuration file paths, increasing the probability of unreported

  * srclib/pcre and vendor/pcre
    http://www.vuxml.org/freebsd/pkg-pcre.html

    update to pcre-7.8
    outcome: remove from trunk, leave alone in branches/2.2.x and branches/2.0.x

 * core, authn/z: Avoid calling access control hooks for internal requests
   with configurations which match those of initial request.  Revert to
   original behaviour (call access control hooks for internal requests
   with URIs different from initial request) if any access control hooks or
   providers are not registered as permitting this optimization.
   Introduce wrappers for access control hook and provider registration
   which can accept additional mode and flag data.  Convert common
   provider version strings to macros.
   The core purpose of this pile of patches is to avoid unnecessary
   authn/z hooks when a single request spawns large numbers of internal
   requests to which an identical set of httpd configurations apply.
   This permits modules such as mod_authn_dbd and mod_dav to work together
   acceptably.
   Because certain external modules such as mod_authz_svn rely on the old
   behaviour, this optimization can be made only when all authn/z hooks and
   providers are registered with the appropriate flag.
   It would be excellent if Windows and NetWare people could ensure this
   builds correctly.
   In particular, mod_auth.h must be included into request.c and I've left
   mod_auth.h under modules/aaa rather than try to replicate wrowe's work
   in trunk moving all the include files around.
   I'm open to suggestions that this remain in trunk only, but in that case,
   it would be very helpful to know whether most people expect a 2.4 branch
   or just a 3.0 branch to be next.  If 3.0, some of the backwards
   compatibility work could potentially be ditched.

    2.2.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~minfrin/httpd-cache-partial-2.2.patch
    +1: minfrin
    niq asks: I can see the logic of not cacheing partial responses,
    but why should mod_disk_cache worry about them if mod_cache allows
    them, as in the following proposal?
    rpluem says: As poirier correctly mentions, the same must be done for mod_mem_cache
    as well.

  *) mod_cache: Explicitly allow cache implementations to cache a 206 Partial
     Response if they so choose to do so. Previously an attempt to cache a 206
     was arbitrarily allowed if the response contained an Expires or
     Cache-Control header, and arbitrarily denied if both headers were missing.

     -1: rpluem: Until the patch proposal above for mod_disk_cache is backported
                 and a similar patch for mod_mem_cache is proposed (no backport
                 possible since mod_mem_cache is no longer in trunk) and
                 committed.

   * mod_proxy: Release the backend connection as soon as EOS is detected,
     so the backend isn't forced to wait for the client to eventually
     acknowledge the data.

     rpluem says: r1052224 r1052314 need to be added as well as the patch above
                  has a thread safety issue.
     minfrin: r1055246 needs to be added to r1052314 to ensure the cleanup
              isn't attempted twice.
     rpluem says: Mind to update the 2.2.x version of the patch with r1052224,
                  r1052314, r1055246 and r1055570 (Comment fix by Jim)?

  * cross-compile: allow to provide CC_FOR_BUILD so that gen_test_char will be
    compiled by the build compiler instead of the host compiler.
    Also set CC_FOR_BUILD to 'cc' when cross-compilation is detected.
    Since PCRE is included with 2.2.x this patch also takes care for dftables.
