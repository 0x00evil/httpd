RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * 16 bit CGIs (which included win9x batch files) were completely
      broken  by 1.3.14.  The fix is in, but it interferes with console
      and service processing on 9x.  A patch is in the works, OtherBill
      expects it to be resolved Saturday.

RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * long pathnames with many components and no AllowOverride None
      Workaround is to define <Directory /> with AllowOverride None,
      which is something all sites should do in any case.
	Status: Marc was looking at it.

    * Ronald Tschalär's patch to mod_proxy to allow other modules to
      set headers too (needed by mod_auth_digest)
        Message-ID: <199907080712.JAA28269@chill.innovation.ch>
        Status:

    * Jayaram's patch (10/27/99) to fix PR4856
        PR: 4856 It is found that UnSetEnv directive fails to unset the
	environment variable in the server config context.
	Status:

    * Jayaram's patch (10/27/99) for changes to mod_autoindex
 
	Problem 1:
	------------------------
	AddIcon (<alttext>,<icon>) ^^DIRECTORY^^ 
	and 
	AddIcon (<alttext>,<icon>) ^^BLANKICON^^ 
	should be able to set the alternate text and icon file for any
	directory/blankicon in a directory listing. This was not happening
	because the alternate text for ^^DIRECTORY^^ and ^^BLANKICON^^ were
	hardcoded to  "DIR" and "   " respectively.

	Problem 2:
	-------------------------
	IndexIgnore <file-extension> should hide the files with this file-
	extension in directory listings. This was NOT happening because the 
	total filename was being compared with the file-extension.

	Status: Martin +1(untested), Ken +1(untested)

In progress:

    * Doug MacEachern's libapr - Generic Apache Request Library (Alpha)
      This package contains modules for manipulating client request data
      via the Apache API with Perl and C.
        Status: http://perl.apache.org/dist/ (look for the latest libapr-* file)

    * David Harris' note of odd size memory allocations.  Dean notes
      that this is due to BLOCK_MIN_ALLOC.  Should we reduce it to 1024?
      Discussion in thread following message-ID below.
	Message-ID: <00a001bedc00$fbc5af60$0500a8c0@delf>
	Status: 

    * Martin Kraemer's mod_ebcdic.c: a new module which will contain the
      ebcdic related stuff (common to all ebcdic based os's) and will
      allow for flexible configuration of the conversion rules. That
      will replace the current hardwired heuristics.
	Message-Id: none yet
	Status: first prototype running, to be posted to list soon.

Needs patch:

    * MaxRequestsPerChild doesn't count requests, only the
      number of connections processed.
      We can either 'fix' it by renaming the directive to
      MaxConnectionsPerChild or really fix it to actually count
      the number of requests.
      Lars: I think we should really fix.
      Ken: Definitely fix this, otherwise a massive series of
           requests on the same connection is possible, which
           defeats the purpose.
      Jim: The main idea behind this is to avoid problems with
           memory leaks. So it really doesn't matter which we
	   do, as long as there's a match between the directive
	   and what it does. Since it's easier, I'd say just
	   rename to MaxConnectionsPerChild but keep MaxRequestsPerChild
	   as an "alias" to that (maybe print a short "MaxRequestsPerChild
	   is depreciated" message when Apache starts).

    * get_path_info bug; ap_get_remote_host should be ap_vformatter instead.
      See: <Pine.LNX.3.96dg4.980427034301.16648P-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>

    * URI issues
	- RFC2068 requires a server to recognize its own IP addr(s) in dot
	notation, we do this fine if the user follows the dns-caveats
	documentation... we should handle it in the case the user doesn't ever
	supply a dot-notation address.

    * Problems dealing with .-rooted domain names such as "twinlark." versus
	"twinlark.arctic.org.".  See the thread containing
	Message-ID: <19980203211817.06723@deejai.mch.sni.de> for more details.
	In particular this affects the correctness of the proxy and the
	vhost mechanism.

    * proxy_*_canon routines use r->proxyreq incorrectly.  See
	<Pine.LNX.3.96dg4.980304030057.13656O-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>

    * work around a Navigator/Mozilla bug when mod_proxy is used
      (broken images).
	Message-ID: <XFMail.980802025055.sfx@unix-ag.org>
        Status: Lars' patch was vetoed.  Roy and Dean think that it is
                probably another buffer magic number error and should be
                tested to find out and, if so, fixed like it was in core.
		Dirkx: cannot reproduce this at all.

    * ap_escape_html() always duplicates the string, even when there is
      no change and the caller would be happy to use the original.
      What is needed is a separate interface for "don't need a dup"
      situations, like just about everywhere we use it in bvputs and
      bputs calls.
      dirkx: -1 (as some of the modules from modules.apache.org seem
	(rightly?) to assume that they can modify the returned escaped
	string whilst relying on the passed string not to be damaged.
      Martin: +1 (a "separate interface" is like in the case of
        ap_table_setn() complementing ap_table_set(). It would not
	interfere with any existing code).

    * Should we disallow requests with bogus characters in the method?
      See <Pine.LNX.3.96dg4.990107093844.14158A-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>

Open issues:

    * Should we provide a way to force CustomError responses past IE's
      'prettify-if-less-than-N-bytes' bogosity?

    * there are still some PRs about inetd mode
      Should we deprecate "ServerType inetd" if the next release is 1.4.0?
        +1: Lars
	-0: Martin (ISTR someone volunteered to "keep it working". I fear
	    some exotic platforms may require it)

    * general/3787: SERVER_PORT is always 80 if client comes to any port
      => needs review by the protocol guys, I think.

    * Paul would like to see a 'gdbm' option because he uses
      it a lot.
	-0: Greg (volunteers; will add to 2.0 series rather than 1.3)
        +1: Martin

    * All DBMs suffer from confusion in dbmmanage (perl script) since the
        dbmmanage creates in the first-matched dbm format.  This is not
        necessarily the library that Apache was built with.  Aught to
        rewrite dbmmanage with the proper library for clean administration.

    * SDBM is now distributed in src/lib, as distributed with mod_dav, but
      is only incorporated into the Win32 build.  Extra cleanup and build 
      mechanics are still needed for other platforms.

    * Maybe a http_paths.h file? See
	<Pine.BSF.3.95q.971209222046.25627D-100000@valis.worldgate.com>
	+1: Brian, Paul, Ralf, Martin, Dirkx
	+0: Jim (not for 1.3.0)

    * Release builds: Should we provide Configuration or not?
      Should we 'make all suexec' in src/support?
	+1: Brian, Jim, Dirkx, Ken +1 (possible suexec path issue, though)

    * root's environment is inherited by the Apache server. Jim & Ken
      think we should recommend using 'env' to build the
      appropriate environment. Marc and Alexei don't see any
      big deal. Martin says that not every "env" has a -u flag. 

    * Marc's socket options like source routing (kill them?)
	Marc, Martin say Yes

    * Ken's PR#1053: an error when accessing a negotiated document
      explicitly names the variant selected.  Should it do so, or should
      the original URI be referenced?
        Martin: keep as is (helps identifying errors. IMO no privacy issue.)

    * Proposed API Changes:

	- r->content_language is for backwards compatibility... with modules
	  that may not link any longer without some minor editing.  The new
	  field is r->content_languages.  Heck it's not even mentioned in
	  apache-devsite/mmn.txt when we got content_languages (note the s!).
	  The proposal is to remove r->content_language:
	    Status: Paul +1, Ralf +1, Ken +1, Martin +1, Dirkx +1 (I could
		not find ANY module which uses it and which (still) compiles
		after the config change.)

	- child_exit() is redundant, it can be implemented via cleanups.  It is
	  not "symmetric" in the sense that there is no exit API method to go
	  along with the init() API method.  There is no need for an exit
	  method, there are already modules using cleanups to perform this (see
	  mod_mmap_static, and mod_php3 for example).  The proposal is to
	  remove the child_exit() method and document cleanups as the method of
	  handling this need.
	    Status: Rasmus +1, Paul +1, Jim +1, 
	            Martin +1, Ralf +1, Ken +1, 
		    Dirkx +1 (with doc change)

    * Should we re-enable nagle now that we're non-buffering CGIs?  See
      various messages from Marc in March 98.
  
    * TZ should not be dealt with specially any longer now that we have
      "PassEnv".  See
      <Pine.LNX.3.96dg4.980309224241.11283X-100000@twinlark.arctic.org>
       Jim: IMO it's too late in the game for this... I'm
            sure this would cause some strange bug reports as
	    people's cgi-scripts no longer work correctly
	    ("It worked just fine before I upgraded to 1.3.0")
	    unless we warn people in big nasty letters to add
	    PassEnv TZ to their config files "just in case"
	    and hope they do it :)
       Dirkx: Is not this the same issue about maintaining your 'env' ?

    * In ap_bclose() there's no test that (fb->fd != -1) -- so it's
      possible that it'll do something completely bogus when it's 
      used for read-only things. - Dean Gaudet

    * Roy's HTTP/1.1 Wishlist items:
        1) byte range error handling

    * use of spawnvp in uncompress_child in mod_mime_magic - doesn't
      use the new child_info structure, is this still safe?  Needs to be 
      looked at.

    * suexec doesn't understand argv parameters; e.g.

        <!--#exec cmd="./ls -l" -->

      fails even when "ls" is in the same directory because suexec is trying
      to stat a file called "ls -l".  A patch for this is available at

        http://www.xnet.com/~emarshal/suexec.diff

      and it's not bad except that it doesn't handle programs with spaces in
      the filename (think win32, or samba-mounted filesystems).  There are
      several PR's to this and I don't see for security reasons why we can't
      accomodate it, though it does add complexity to suexec.c.
      Accepting quoted executable names solves that issue.
      PR #1120
      Brian: +1
      
Win32 specific issues:

 Important

    * fix O(n^2) attack in mod_isapi.c ... i.e. recopy the code from
      scan_script_headers_err_core.  Concept patch available for review
      from OtherBill <002001bff8b6$cb53b420$345985d0@corecomm.net>
        Status: Is this done, now that we use scan_script_headers_err_strs?

    * Apache console on Windows 95 alone won't close, close button/menu 
      option can't (?) be intercepted, any workarounds out there?
      There is also an unverified report that Apache in a Win98 (95?) 
      console window is ignoring shutdown/logoff, but this is not a
      confirmed report, and Apache as a hidden service does not share
      this reported problem.  Perhaps this is a child process issue,
      or just a simple matter of timing, since a hidden window exists
      to intercept these conditions.

 In progress:

    * Windows install script review/revision?
        - Daniel S. Reichenbach is cooking something up.

    * Ben's ASP work... All agree it sounds cool.

    * Adding a tray application to the Windoze version for ease of
      status/management.  (PR3594, PR4873)
        No one has implemented a pure C language WinAPI (no MFC) 
        multiple-services aware taskbar app for both WinNT and Win95,
        since multiple-services are recent and Win9x is even more
        recent.  Open to anyone proposing something complete.
        If it comes between releases, add it to contrib right away!
        See src/os/win32/monitoring-services.txt for details.
        Status: both Brian Moon and William Rowe are experimenting.

 Help:
    * chdir() for CGI scripts and mod_include #exec needs to be 
      re-implemented now that CreateProcess is being used.

    * process/thread model
	- need dynamic thread creation/destruction, similar to 
	  Unix process model

    * some errors printed by CGIs to stderr don't end up making it
      to the server log unless an extra debugging message is added
      after they run? (PR#1725 indicates this may not be just Win32)

    * handle bugs that make it pop up errors on console, ie. segv 
      equiv?  Can we do this?  Need to make it robust.

    * install
	- make installshield work
	- config in cvs tree?
	- install docs, etc.?
	- location for install

    * the mutex should be critical-regions, since the current design
      is creating a mess of SO calls that are unnecessary

    * performance

    * modules that need to be made to work on win32
        - mod_example isn't multithreadreded
	- mod_unique_id (needs mt changes)
	- mod_log_agent.c
	- mod_log_referer.c
	- mod_mime_magic.c (needs access to mod_mime API stage...)

    * do something to disable bogus warnings

    * rfc1413.c has static storage which won't work multithreaded

    * mod_include --> exec cgi, exec cmd, etc. don't work right.
      Looks like a code path that isn't run anywhere else that has
      something not quite right...  A PR or two on it.

    * Currently if you double click on the conf files or the
      log files you get a useless dialog offering the set of all
      executables, usually after a very long pause.  Ought
      to stuff .conf in the registry mapping it to text.

    * apparently either "BrowserMatch" or the "nokeepalive" variable
      cause instability - see PR#1729.
