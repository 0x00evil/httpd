    <ol>
      <li>
        <a id="what2do" name="what2do"><strong>"Why can't I ...?
        Why won't ... work?" What to do in case of
        problems</strong></a> 

        <p>If you are having trouble with your Apache server
        software, you should take the following steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Check the errorlog!</strong> 

            <p>Apache tries to be helpful when it encounters a
            problem. In many cases, it will provide some details by
            writing one or messages to the server error log.
            Sometimes this is enough for you to diagnose &amp; fix
            the problem yourself (such as file permissions or the
            like). The default location of the error log is
            <samp>/usr/local/apache/logs/error_log</samp>, but see
            the <a
            href="../mod/core.html#errorlog"><samp>ErrorLog</samp></a>
            directive in your config files for the location on your
            server.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Check the <a
            href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html">FAQ</a>!</strong>
            

            <p>The latest version of the Apache Frequently-Asked
            Questions list can always be found at the main Apache
            web site.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Check the Apache bug database</strong> 

            <p>Most problems that get reported to The Apache Group
            are recorded in the <a
            href="http://bugs.apache.org/">bug database</a>.
            <em><strong>Please</strong> check the existing reports,
            open <strong>and</strong> closed, before adding
            one.</em> If you find that your issue has already been
            reported, please <em>don't</em> add a "me, too" report.
            If the original report isn't closed yet, we suggest
            that you check it periodically. You might also consider
            contacting the original submitter, because there may be
            an email exchange going on about the issue that isn't
            getting recorded in the database.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Ask in a user support group.</strong> 

            <p>A lot of common problems never make it to the bug
            database because there's already high Q&amp;A traffic
            about them in the <a
            href="http://httpd.apache.org/userslist.html">Users
            mailing list</a> or <a
            href="news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix"><samp>comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix</samp></a>
            and related newsgroups. These newsgroups are also
            available via <a
            href="http://groups.google.com/groups?group=comp.infosystems.www.servers">
            Google</a>. Many Apache users, and some of the developers,
            can be found roaming their virtual halls, so it is suggested
            that you seek wisdom there. The chances are good that
            you'll get a faster answer there than from the bug
            database, even if you <em>don't</em> see your question
            already posted.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>If all else fails, report the problem in the
            bug database</strong> 

            <p>If you've gone through those steps above that are
            appropriate and have obtained no relief, then please
            <em>do</em> let The Apache Group know about the problem
            by <a
            href="http://httpd.apache.org/bug_report.html">logging
            a bug report</a>.</p>

            <p>If your problem involves the server crashing and
            generating a core dump, please include a backtrace (if
            possible). As an example,</p>

            <dl>
              <dd><code># cd <em>ServerRoot</em><br />
               # dbx httpd core<br />
               (dbx) where</code></dd>
            </dl>

            <p>(Substitute the appropriate locations for your
            <samp>ServerRoot</samp> and your <samp>httpd</samp> and
            <samp>core</samp> files. You may have to use
            <code>gdb</code> instead of <code>dbx</code>.)</p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <a id="submit_patch" name="submit_patch"><strong>How do I
        submit a patch to the Apache Group?</strong></a> 

        <p>The Apache Group encourages patches from outside
        developers. There are 2 main "types" of patches: small
        bugfixes and general improvements. Bugfixes should be
        submitting using the Apache <a
        href="http://httpd.apache.org/bug_report.html">bug report
        page</a>. Improvements, modifications, and additions should
        follow the instructions below.</p>

        <p>In general, the first course of action is to be a member
        of the <samp>dev@httpd.apache.org</samp> mailing list. This
        indicates to the Group that you are closely following the
        latest Apache developments. Your patch file should be
        generated using either '<code>diff&nbsp;-c</code>' or
        '<code>diff&nbsp;-u</code>' against the latest CVS tree. To
        submit your patch, send email to
        <samp>dev@httpd.apache.org</samp> with a
        <samp>Subject:</samp> line that starts with
        <samp>[PATCH]</samp> and includes a general description of
        the patch. In the body of the message, the patch should be
        clearly described and then included at the end of the
        message. If the patch-file is long, you can note a URL to
        the file instead of the file itself. Use of MIME
        enclosures/attachments should be avoided.</p>

        <p>Be prepared to respond to any questions about your
        patches and possibly defend your code. If your patch
        results in a lot of discussion, you may be asked to submit
        an updated patch that incorporates all changes and
        suggestions.</p>

      <li>
        <a id="domination" name="domination"><strong>Why has Apache
        stolen my favourite site's Internet address?</strong></a> 

        <p>The simple answer is: "It hasn't." This misconception is
        usually caused by the site in question having migrated to
        the Apache Web server software, but not having migrated the
        site's content yet. When Apache is installed, the default
        page that gets installed tells the Webmaster the
        installation was successful. The expectation is that this
        default page will be replaced with the site's real content.
        If it doesn't, complain to the Webmaster, not to the Apache
        project -- we just make the software and aren't responsible
        for what people do (or don't do) with it.</p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <a id="apspam" name="apspam"><strong>Why am I getting spam
        mail from the Apache site?</strong></a> 

        <p>The short answer is: "You aren't." Usually when someone
        thinks the Apache site is originating spam, it's because
        they've traced the spam to a Web site, and the Web site
        says it's using Apache. See the <a
        href="#domination">previous FAQ entry</a> for more details
        on this phenomenon.</p>

        <p>No marketing spam originates from the Apache site. The
        only mail that comes from the site goes only to addresses
        that have been <em>requested</em> to receive the mail.</p>

      <li>
        <a id="redist" name="redist"><strong>May I include the
        Apache software on a CD or other package I'm
        distributing?</strong></a> 

        <p>The detailed answer to this question can be found in the
        Apache license, which is included in the Apache
        distribution in the file <code>LICENSE</code>. You can also
        find it on the Web at <samp>&lt;<a
        href="http://www.apache.org/LICENSE.txt">http://www.apache.org/LICENSE.txt</a>&gt;</samp>.</p>

        <a id="zoom" name="zoom"><strong>What's the best
        hardware/operating system/... How do I get the most out of
        my Apache Web server?</strong></a> 

        <p>Check out Dean Gaudet's <a
        href="perf-tuning.html">performance tuning page</a>.</p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <a id="regex" name="regex"><strong>What are "regular
        expressions"?</strong></a> 

        <p>Regular expressions are a way of describing a pattern -
        for example, "all the words that begin with the letter A"
        or "every 10-digit phone number" or even "Every sentence
        with two commas in it, and no capital letter Q". Regular
        expressions (aka "regex"s) are useful in Apache because
        they let you apply certain attributes against collections
        of files or resources in very flexible ways - for example,
        all .gif and .jpg files under any "images" directory could
        be written as /\/images\/.*(jpg|gif)$/.</p>

        <p>The best overview around is probably the one which comes
        with Perl. We implement a simple subset of Perl's regex
        support, but it's still a good way to learn what they mean.
        You can start by going to the <a
        href="http://www.perl.com/doc/manual/html/pod/perlre.html">CPAN
        page on regular expressions</a>, and branching out from
        there.</p> <hr />
      </li>

      <li>
        <a id="binaries" name="binaries"><b>Why isn't there a
        binary for my platform?</b></a> 

        <p>The developers make sure that the software builds and
        works correctly on the platforms available to them; this
        does <i>not</i> necessarily mean that <i>your</i> platform
        is one of them. In addition, the Apache HTTP server project
        is primarily source oriented, meaning that distributing
        valid and buildable source code is the purpose of a
        release, not making sure that there is a binary package for
        all of the supported platforms.</p>

        <p>If you don't see a kit for your platform listed in the
        binary distribution area (&lt;URL:<a
        href="http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/">http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/</a>&gt;),
        it means either that the platform isn't available to any of
        the developers, or that they just haven't gotten around to
        preparing a binary for it. As this is a voluntary project,
        they are under no obligation to do so. Users are encouraged
        and expected to build the software themselves.</p>

        <p>The sole exception to these practices is the Windows
        package. Unlike most Unix and Unix-like platforms, Windows
        systems do not come with a bundled software development
        environment, so we <i>do</i> prepare binary kits for
        Windows when we make a release. Again, however, it's a
        voluntary thing and only a limited number of the developers
        have the capability to build the InstallShield package, so
        the Windows release may lag somewhat behind the source
        release. This lag should be no more than a few days at
        most.</p>
