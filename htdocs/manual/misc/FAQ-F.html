    <h3>F. Dynamic Content (CGI and SSI)</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <a id="CGIoutsideScriptAlias"
        name="CGIoutsideScriptAlias"><strong>How do I enable CGI
        execution in directories other than the
        ScriptAlias?</strong></a> 

        <p>Apache recognizes all files in a directory named as a <a
        href="../mod/mod_alias.html#scriptalias"><samp>ScriptAlias</samp></a>
        as being eligible for execution rather than processing as
        normal documents. This applies regardless of the file name,
        so scripts in a ScriptAlias directory don't need to be
        named "<samp>*.cgi</samp>" or "<samp>*.pl</samp>" or
        whatever. In other words, <em>all</em> files in a
        ScriptAlias directory are scripts, as far as Apache is
        concerned.</p>

        <p>To persuade Apache to execute scripts in other
        locations, such as in directories where normal documents
        may also live, you must tell it how to recognize them - and
        also that it's okay to execute them. For this, you need to
        use something like the <a
        href="../mod/mod_mime.html#addhandler"><samp>AddHandler</samp></a>
        directive.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            In an appropriate section of your server configuration
            files, add a line such as 

            <dl>
              <dd><code>AddHandler cgi-script .cgi</code></dd>
            </dl>

            <p>The server will then recognize that all files in
            that location (and its logical descendants) that end in
            "<samp>.cgi</samp>" are script files, not
            documents.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Make sure that the directory location is covered by
          an <a
          href="../mod/core.html#options"><samp>Options</samp></a>
          declaration that includes the <samp>ExecCGI</samp>
          option.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In some situations, you might not want to actually allow
        all files named "<samp>*.cgi</samp>" to be executable.
        Perhaps all you want is to enable a particular file in a
        normal directory to be executable. This can be
        alternatively accomplished <em>via</em> <a
        href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html"><samp>mod_rewrite</samp></a>
        and the following steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Locally add to the corresponding <samp>.htaccess</samp>
            file a ruleset similar to this one: 

            <dl>
              <dd><code>RewriteEngine on<br />
               RewriteBase /~foo/bar/<br />
               RewriteRule ^quux\.cgi$ -
              [T=application/x-httpd-cgi]</code></dd>
            </dl>
          </li>

          <li>Make sure that the directory location is covered by
          an <a
          href="../mod/core.html#options"><samp>Options</samp></a>
          declaration that includes the <samp>ExecCGI</samp> and
          <samp>FollowSymLinks</samp> option.</li>
        </ol>
        <hr />
      </li>

      <li>
        <a id="premature-script-headers"
        name="premature-script-headers"><strong>What does it mean
        when my CGIs fail with "<samp>Premature end of script
        headers</samp>"?</strong></a> 

        <p>It means just what it says: the server was expecting a
        complete set of HTTP headers (one or more followed by a
        blank line), and didn't get them.</p>

        <p>The most common cause of this problem is the script
        dying before sending the complete set of headers, or
        possibly any at all, to the server. To see if this is the
        case, try running the script standalone from an interactive
        session, rather than as a script under the server. If you
        get error messages, this is almost certainly the cause of
        the "premature end of script headers" message. Even if the
        CGI runs fine from the command line, remember that the
        environment and permissions may be different when running
        under the web server. The CGI can only access resources
        allowed for the <a
        href="../mod/core.html#user"><code>User</code></a> and <a
        href="../mod/core.html#group"><code>Group</code></a>
        specified in your Apache configuration. In addition, the
        environment will not be the same as the one provided on the
        command line, but it can be adjusted using the directives
        provided by <a href="../mod/mod_env.html">mod_env</a>.</p>

        <p>The second most common cause of this (aside from people
        not outputting the required headers at all) is a result of
        an interaction with Perl's output buffering. To make Perl
        flush its buffers after each output statement, insert the
        following statements around the <code>print</code> or
        <code>write</code> statements that send your HTTP
        headers:</p>

        <dl>
          <dd><code>{<br />
           &nbsp;local ($oldbar) = $|;<br />
           &nbsp;$cfh = select (STDOUT);<br />
           &nbsp;$| = 1;<br />
           &nbsp;#<br />
           &nbsp;# print your HTTP headers here<br />
           &nbsp;#<br />
           &nbsp;$| = $oldbar;<br />
           &nbsp;select ($cfh);<br />
           }</code></dd>
        </dl>

        <p>This is generally only necessary when you are calling
        external programs from your script that send output to
        stdout, or if there will be a long delay between the time
        the headers are sent and the actual content starts being
        emitted. To maximize performance, you should turn
        buffer-flushing back <em>off</em> (with <code>$| = 0</code>
        or the equivalent) after the statements that send the
        headers, as displayed above.</p>

        <p>If your script isn't written in Perl, do the equivalent
        thing for whatever language you <em>are</em> using
        (<em>e.g.</em>, for C, call <code>fflush()</code> after
        writing the headers).</p>

        <p>Another cause for the "premature end of script headers"
        message are the RLimitCPU and RLimitMEM directives. You may
        get the message if the CGI script was killed due to a
        resource limit.</p>

        <p>In addition, a configuration problem in <a
        href="../suexec.html">suEXEC</a>, mod_perl, or another
        third party module can often interfere with the execution
        of your CGI and cause the "premature end of script headers"
        message.</p>

      <li>
        <a id="POSTnotallowed" name="POSTnotallowed"><strong>Why do
        I keep getting "Method Not Allowed" for form POST
        requests?</strong></a> 

        <p>This is almost always due to Apache not being configured
        to treat the file you are trying to POST to as a CGI
        script. You can not POST to a normal HTML file; the
        operation has no meaning. See the FAQ entry on <a
        href="#CGIoutsideScriptAlias">CGIs outside ScriptAliased
        directories</a> for details on how to configure Apache to
        treat the file in question as a CGI.</p>
        <hr />
      </li>

      <li>
        <a id="nph-scripts" name="nph-scripts"><strong>How can I
        get my script's output without Apache buffering it? Why
        doesn't my server push work?</strong></a> 

        <p>As of Apache 1.3, CGI scripts are essentially not
        buffered. Every time your script does a "flush" to output
        data, that data gets relayed on to the client. Some
        scripting languages, for example Perl, have their own
        buffering for output - this can be disabled by setting the
        <code>$|</code> special variable to 1. Of course this does
        increase the overall number of packets being transmitted,
        which can result in a sense of slowness for the end
        user.</p>

        <p>Prior to 1.3, you needed to use "nph-" scripts to
        accomplish non-buffering. Today, the only difference
        between nph scripts and normal scripts is that nph scripts
        require the full HTTP headers to be sent.</p>

      <li>
        <a id="cgi-spec" name="cgi-spec"><strong>Where can I find
        the "CGI specification"?</strong></a> 

        <p>The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) specification can be
        found at the original NCSA site &lt; <a
        href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/interface.html"><samp>
        http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/interface.html</samp></a>&gt;.
        This version hasn't been updated since 1995, and there have
        been some efforts to update it.</p>

        <p>A new draft is being worked on with the intent of making
        it an informational RFC; you can find out more about this
        project at &lt;<a
        href="http://web.golux.com/coar/cgi/"><samp>http://web.golux.com/coar/cgi/</samp></a>&gt;.</p>

      <li>
        <a id="fastcgi" name="fastcgi"><strong>Why isn't FastCGI
        included with Apache any more?</strong></a> 

        <p>The simple answer is that it was becoming too difficult
        to keep the version being included with Apache synchronized
        with the master copy at the <a
        href="http://www.fastcgi.com/">FastCGI web site</a>. When a
        new version of Apache was released, the version of the
        FastCGI module included with it would soon be out of
        date.</p>

        <p>You can still obtain the FastCGI module for Apache from
        the master FastCGI web site.</p>

      <li>
        <a id="ssi-part-i" name="ssi-part-i"><strong>How do I
        enable SSI (parsed HTML)?</strong></a> 

        <p>SSI (an acronym for Server-Side Include) directives
        allow static HTML documents to be enhanced at run-time
        (<em>e.g.</em>, when delivered to a client by Apache). The
        format of SSI directives is covered in the <a
        href="../mod/mod_include.html">mod_include manual</a>;
        suffice it to say that Apache supports not only SSI but
        xSSI (eXtended SSI) directives.</p>

        <p>Processing a document at run-time is called
        <em>parsing</em> it; hence the term "parsed HTML" sometimes
        used for documents that contain SSI instructions. Parsing
        tends to be resource-consumptive compared to serving static
        files, and is not enabled by default. It can also interfere
        with the cachability of your documents, which can put a
        further load on your server. (See the <a
        href="#ssi-part-ii">next question</a> for more information
        about this.)</p>

        <p>To enable SSI processing, you need to</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Build your server with the <a
          href="../mod/mod_include.html"><samp>mod_include</samp></a>
          module. This is normally compiled in by default.</li>

          <li>Make sure your server configuration files have an <a
          href="../mod/core.html#options"><samp>Options</samp></a>
          directive which permits <samp>Includes</samp>.</li>

          <li>
            Make sure that the directory where you want the SSI
            documents to live is covered by the "server-parsed"
            content handler, either explicitly or in some ancestral
            location. That can be done with the following <a
            href="../mod/mod_mime.html#addhandler"><samp>AddHandler</samp></a>
            directive: 

            <dl>
              <dd><code>AddHandler server-parsed .shtml</code></dd>
            </dl>

            <p>This indicates that all files ending in ".shtml" in
            that location (or its descendants) should be parsed.
            Note that using ".html" will cause all normal HTML
            files to be parsed, which may put an inordinate load on
            your server.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>For additional information, see the <cite>Apache
        Week</cite> article on <a
        href="http://www.apacheweek.com/features/ssi"
        rel="Help"><cite>Using Server Side Includes</cite></a>.</p>
        <hr />

      <li>
        <a id="ssi-part-ii" name="ssi-part-ii"><strong>Why don't my
        parsed files get cached?</strong></a> 

        <p>Since the server is performing run-time processing of
        your SSI directives, which may change the content shipped
        to the client, it can't know at the time it starts parsing
        what the final size of the result will be, or whether the
        parsed result will always be the same. This means that it
        can't generate <samp>Content-Length</samp> or
        <samp>Last-Modified</samp> headers. Caches commonly work by
        comparing the <samp>Last-Modified</samp> of what's in the
        cache with that being delivered by the server. Since the
        server isn't sending that header for a parsed document,
        whatever's doing the caching can't tell whether the
        document has changed or not - and so fetches it again to be
        on the safe side.</p>

        <p>You can work around this in some cases by causing an
        <samp>Expires</samp> header to be generated. (See the <a
        href="../mod/mod_expires.html"
        rel="Help"><samp>mod_expires</samp></a> documentation for
        more details.) Another possibility is to use the <a
        href="../mod/mod_include.html#xbithack"
        rel="Help"><samp>XBitHack Full</samp></a> mechanism, which
        tells Apache to send (under certain circumstances detailed
        in the XBitHack directive description) a
        <samp>Last-Modified</samp> header based upon the last
        modification time of the file being parsed. Note that this
        may actually be lying to the client if the parsed file
        doesn't change but the SSI-inserted content does; if the
        included content changes often, this can result in stale
        copies being cached.</p>

      <li>
        <a id="ssi-part-iii" name="ssi-part-iii"><strong>How can I
        have my script output parsed?</strong></a> 

        <p>So you want to include SSI directives in the output from
        your CGI script, but can't figure out how to do it? The
        short answer is "you can't." This is potentially a security
        liability and, more importantly, it can not be cleanly
        implemented under the current server API. The best
        workaround is for your script itself to do what the SSIs
        would be doing. After all, it's generating the rest of the
        content.</p>

        <p>This is a feature The Apache Group hopes to add in the
        next major release after 1.3.</p>

        work for VirtualHosts and/or user home
        directories.</strong></a> 

        <p>This is almost always due to having some setting in your

        is the environment variable <samp>REMOTE_USER</samp> not
        set?</strong></a> 

        <p>This variable is set and thus available in SSI or CGI
        scripts <strong>if and only if</strong> the requested
        document was protected by access authentication. For an
        explanation on how to implement these restrictions, see <a
        href="http://www.apacheweek.com/"><cite>Apache
        Week</cite></a>'s articles on <a
        href="http://www.apacheweek.com/features/userauth"><cite>Using
        User Authentication</cite></a> or <a
        href="http://www.apacheweek.com/features/dbmauth"><cite>DBM
        User Authentication</cite></a>.</p>

        <p>Hint: When using a CGI script to receive the data of a
        HTML <samp>FORM</samp> notice that protecting the document
        containing the <samp>FORM</samp> is not sufficient to
        provide <samp>REMOTE_USER</samp> to the CGI script. You
        have to protect the CGI script, too. Or alternatively only
        the CGI script (then authentication happens only after
        filling out the form).</p>

        <a id="user-cgi" name="user-cgi"><strong>How do I allow
        each of my user directories to have a cgi-bin
        directory?</strong></a> 

        <p>Remember that CGI execution does not need to be
        restricted only to cgi-bin directories. You can <a
        href="#CGIoutsideScriptAlias">allow CGI script execution in
        arbitrary parts of your filesystem</a>.</p>

        <p>There are many ways to give each user directory a
        cgi-bin directory such that anything requested as
        <samp>http://example.com/~user/cgi-bin/program</samp> will
        be executed as a CGI script. Two alternatives are:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Place the cgi-bin directory next to the public_html
            directory: 

            <dl>
              <dd><code>ScriptAliasMatch ^/~([^/]*)/cgi-bin/(.*)
              /home/$1/cgi-bin/$2</code></dd>
            </dl>
          </li>

          <li>
            Place the cgi-bin directory underneath the public_html
            directory: 

            <dl>
              <dd><code>&lt;Directory
              /home/*/public_html/cgi-bin&gt;<br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options ExecCGI<br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SetHandler cgi-script<br />
               &lt;/Directory&gt;</code></dd>
            </dl>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you are using suexec, the first technique will not work
        because CGI scripts must be stored under the <code>public_html</code>
        directory.</p>
