    <h3>G. Authentication and Access Restrictions</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <a id="dnsauth" name="dnsauth"><strong>Why isn't
        restricting access by host or domain name working
        correctly?</strong></a> 

        <p>Two of the most common causes of this are:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>An error, inconsistency, or unexpected
          mapping in the DNS registration</strong><br />
           This happens frequently: your configuration restricts
          access to <samp>Host.FooBar.Com</samp>, but you can't get
          in from that host. The usual reason for this is that
          <samp>Host.FooBar.Com</samp> is actually an alias for
          another name, and when Apache performs the
          address-to-name lookup it's getting the <em>real</em>
          name, not <samp>Host.FooBar.Com</samp>. You can verify
          this by checking the reverse lookup yourself. The easiest
          way to work around it is to specify the correct host name
          in your configuration.</li>

          <li>
            <strong>Inadequate checking and verification in your
            configuration of Apache</strong><br />
             If you intend to perform access checking and
            restriction based upon the client's host or domain
            name, you really need to configure Apache to
            double-check the origin information it's supplied. You
            do this by adding the <samp>-DMAXIMUM_DNS</samp> clause
            to the <samp>EXTRA_CFLAGS</samp> definition in your
            <samp>Configuration</samp> file. For example: 

            <dl>
              <dd><code>EXTRA_CFLAGS=-DMAXIMUM_DNS</code></dd>
            </dl>

            <p>This will cause Apache to be very paranoid about
            making sure a particular host address is
            <em>really</em> assigned to the name it claims to be.
            Note that this <em>can</em> incur a significant
            performance penalty, however, because of all the name
            resolution requests being sent to a nameserver.</p>

        <a id="user-authentication"
        name="user-authentication"><strong>How do I set up Apache
        to require a username and password to access certain
        documents?</strong></a> 

        <p>There are several ways to do this; some of the more
        popular ones are to use the <a
        href="../mod/mod_auth.html">mod_auth</a>, <a
        href="../mod/mod_auth_db.html">mod_auth_db</a>, or <a
        href="../mod/mod_auth_dbm.html">mod_auth_dbm</a>
        modules.</p>

        <p>For an explanation on how to implement these
        restrictions, see <a
        href="http://www.apacheweek.com/"><cite>Apache
        Week</cite></a>'s articles on <a
        href="http://www.apacheweek.com/features/userauth"><cite>Using
        User Authentication</cite></a> or <a
        href="http://www.apacheweek.com/features/dbmauth"><cite>DBM
        User Authentication</cite></a>, or see the <a
        href="../howto/auth.html">authentication tutorial</a> in the
        Apache documentation.</p>

      <li>
        <a id="remote-auth-only"
        name="remote-auth-only"><strong>How do I set up Apache to
        allow access to certain documents only if a site is either
        a local site <em>or</em> the user supplies a password and
        username?</strong></a> 

        <p>Use the <a href="../mod/core.html#satisfy">Satisfy</a>
        directive, in particular the <code>Satisfy Any</code>
        directive, to require that only one of the access
        restrictions be met. For example, adding the following
        configuration to a <samp>.htaccess</samp> or server
        configuration file would restrict access to people who
        either are accessing the site from a host under domain.com
        or who can supply a valid username and password:</p>

        <dl>
          <dd><code>Deny from all<br />
           Allow from .domain.com<br />
           AuthType Basic<br />
           AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/conf/htpasswd.users<br />
           AuthName "special directory"<br />
           Require valid-user<br />
           Satisfy any</code></dd>
        </dl>

        <p>See the <a href="#user-authentication">user
        authentication</a> question and the <a
        href="../mod/mod_access.html">mod_access</a> module for
        details on how the above directives work.</p>
        <hr />
      </li>

      <li>
        <a id="authauthoritative"
        name="authauthoritative"><strong>Why does my authentication
        give me a server error?</strong></a> 

        <p>Under normal circumstances, the Apache access control
        modules will pass unrecognized user IDs on to the next
        access control module in line. Only if the user ID is
        recognized and the password is validated (or not) will it
        give the usual success or "authentication failed"
        messages.</p>

        <p>However, if the last access module in line 'declines'
        the validation request (because it has never heard of the
        user ID or because it is not configured), the
        <samp>http_request</samp> handler will give one of the
        following, confusing, errors:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><samp>check access</samp></li>

          <li><samp>check user. No user file?</samp></li>

          <li><samp>check access. No groups file?</samp></li>
        </ul>

        <p>This does <em>not</em> mean that you have to add an
        '<samp>AuthUserFile&nbsp;/dev/null</samp>' line as some
        magazines suggest!</p>

        <p>The solution is to ensure that at least the last module
        is authoritative and <strong>CONFIGURED</strong>. By
        default, <samp>mod_auth</samp> is authoritative and will
        give an OK/Denied, but only if it is configured with the
        proper <samp>AuthUserFile</samp>. Likewise, if a valid
        group is required. (Remember that the modules are processed
        in the reverse order from that in which they appear in your
        compile-time <samp>Configuration</samp> file.)</p>

        <p>A typical situation for this error is when you are using
        the <samp>mod_auth_dbm</samp>, <samp>mod_auth_msql</samp>,
        <samp>mod_auth_mysql</samp>, <samp>mod_auth_anon</samp> or
        <samp>mod_auth_cookie</samp> modules on their own. These
        are by default <strong>not</strong> authoritative, and this
        will pass the buck on to the (non-existent) next
        authentication module when the user ID is not in their
        respective database. Just add the appropriate
        '<samp><em>XXX</em>Authoritative yes</samp>' line to the
        configuration.</p>

        <p>In general it is a good idea (though not terribly
        efficient) to have the file-based <samp>mod_auth</samp> a
        module of last resort. This allows you to access the web
        server with a few special passwords even if the databases
        are down or corrupted. This does cost a file
        open/seek/close for each request in a protected area.</p>

        <a id="auth-on-same-machine"
        name="auth-on-same-machine"><strong>Do I have to keep the
        (mSQL) authentication information on the same
        machine?</strong></a> 

        <p>Some organizations feel very strongly about keeping the
        authentication information on a different machine than the
        webserver. With the <samp>mod_auth_msql</samp>,
        <samp>mod_auth_mysql</samp>, and other SQL modules
        connecting to (R)DBMses this is quite possible. Just
        configure an explicit host to contact.</p>

        <p>Be aware that with mSQL and Oracle, opening and closing
        these database connections is very expensive and time
        consuming. You might want to look at the code in the
        <samp>auth_*</samp> modules and play with the compile time
        flags to alleviate this somewhat, if your RDBMS licences
        allow for it.</p>

      <li>
        <a id="msql-slow" name="msql-slow"><strong>Why is my mSQL
        authentication terribly slow?</strong></a> 

        <p>You have probably configured the Host by specifying a
        FQHN, and thus the <samp>libmsql</samp> will use a full
        blown TCP/IP socket to talk to the database, rather than a
        fast internal device. The <samp>libmsql</samp>, the mSQL
        FAQ, and the <samp>mod_auth_msql</samp> documentation warn
        you about this. If you have to use different hosts, check
        out the <samp>mod_auth_msql</samp> code for some compile
        time flags which might - or might not - suit you.</p>

        <a id="passwdauth" name="passwdauth"><strong>Can I use my
        <samp>/etc/passwd</samp> file for Web page
        authentication?</strong></a> 

        <p>Yes, you can - but it's a <strong>very bad
        idea</strong>. Here are some of the reasons:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The Web technology provides no governors on how often
          or how rapidly password (authentication failure) retries
          can be made. That means that someone can hammer away at
          your system's <samp>root</samp> password using the Web,
          using a dictionary or similar mass attack, just as fast
          as the wire and your server can handle the requests. Most
          operating systems these days include attack detection
          (such as <em>n</em> failed passwords for the same account
          within <em>m</em> seconds) and evasion (breaking the
          connection, disabling the account under attack, disabling
          <em>all</em> logins from that source, <em>et
          cetera</em>), but the Web does not.</li>

          <li>An account under attack isn't notified (unless the
          server is heavily modified); there's no "You have 19483
          login failures" message when the legitimate owner logs
          in.</li>

          <li>Without an exhaustive and error-prone examination of
          the server logs, you can't tell whether an account has
          been compromised. Detecting that an attack has occurred,
          or is in progress, is fairly obvious, though -
          <em>if</em> you look at the logs.</li>

          <li>Web authentication passwords (at least for Basic
          authentication) generally fly across the wire, and
          through intermediate proxy systems, in what amounts to
          plain text. "O'er the net we go/Caching all the way;/O
          what fun it is to surf/Giving my password away!"</li>

          <li>Since HTTP is stateless, information about the
          authentication is transmitted <em>each and every
          time</em> a request is made to the server. Essentially,
          the client caches it after the first successful access,
          and transmits it without asking for all subsequent
          requests to the same server.</li>

          <li>It's relatively trivial for someone on your system to
          put up a page that will steal the cached password from a
          client's cache without them knowing. Can you say
          "password grabber"?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you still want to do this in light of the above
        disadvantages, the method is left as an exercise for the
        reader. It'll void your Apache warranty, though, and you'll
        lose all accumulated UNIX guru points.</p>
        <hr />
      </li>

      <li>
        <a id="prompted-twice" name="prompted-twice"><strong>Why
        does Apache ask for my password twice before serving a
        file?</strong></a> 

        <p>If the hostname under which you are accessing the server
        is different than the hostname specified in the <a
        href="../mod/core.html#servername"><code>ServerName</code></a>
        directive, then depending on the setting of the <a
        href="../mod/core.html#usecanonicalname"><code>UseCanonicalName</code></a>
        directive, Apache will redirect you to a new hostname when
        constructing self-referential URLs. This happens, for
        example, in the case where you request a directory without
        including the trailing slash.</p>

        <p>When this happens, Apache will ask for authentication
        once under the original hostname, perform the redirect, and
        then ask again under the new hostname. For security
        reasons, the browser must prompt again for the password
        when the host name changes.</p>

        <p>To eliminate this problem you should</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Always use the trailing slash when requesting
          directories;</li>

          <li>Change the <code>ServerName</code> to match the name
          you are using in the URL; and/or</li>

          <li>Set <code>UseCanonicalName off</code>.</li>
        </ol>

      <li>
        <a id="image-theft" name="image-theft"><strong>How can I prevent
        people from "stealing" the images from my web site?</strong></a> 

        <p>The goal here is to prevent people from inlining your images
        directly from their web site, but accessing them only if they
        appear inline in your pages.<p>

        <p>This can be accomplished with a combination of SetEnvIf and
        the Deny and Allow directives. However, it is important to 
        understand that any access restriction based on the REFERER
        header is intrinsically problematic due to the fact that 
        browsers can send an incorrect REFERER, either because they 
        want to circumvent your restriction or simply because they don't
        send the right thing (or anything at all).</p>

        <p>The following configuration will produce the desired effect
        if the browser passes correct REFERER headers.</p>

<pre>
SetEnvIf REFERER "www\.mydomain\.com" linked_from_here
SetEnvIf REFERER "^$" linked_from_here

&lt;Directory /www/images&gt;
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
    Allow from env=linked_from_here
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>

href="../env.html#examples">Environment Variables</a> documentation.</p>
