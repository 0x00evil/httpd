<title>New features with Apache 1.2</title>
</head><body>

<!--#include virtual="header.html" -->
<h1>Overview of new features</h1>

<h2>API Changes</h2>

<p>Some non-compatible changes were made to the Apache API in order to
deal with HTTP/1.1 compatibility.  It is possible that some modules
will no longer work (specifically, those that process input using the
POST or PUT methods). If you encounter a module that does not work,
please contact the author. A <a
href="misc/client_block_api.html">programmer's note</a> on the subject is
available.</p>

<h2>New Features with Apache 1.2</h2>
<p>New features with this release, as extensions of the Apache
functionality. Because the core code has changed so
significantly, there are certain liberties that earlier versions of
Apache (and the NCSA daemon) took that recent Apache versions are
pickier about - please check the <a
href="misc/compat_notes.html">compatibility notes</a> if you have any
problems.</p>
<hr>

<p>In addition to a number of bug fixes and internal performance
enhancements, <a href="../dist/">Apache
1.2</a> has the following specific new user features:</p>

<ul>

<li><b><a href="http11.html">HTTP/1.1 Compliance</a></b><br>
Apache (except for the optional proxy) is fully compliant with
the new HTTP/1.1 standard, as ratified
by the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/">IETF HTTP
working group</a>. HTTP/1.1 provides a much-improved protocol, and
should allow for greater performance and efficiency when transfering
files. Apache does, however, still work great with HTTP/1.0 browsers.

<li><b><a href="mod/xssi.html">eXtended Server Side Includes
(XSSI)</a></b><br>
A new set of server-side include
directives allows the user to better create WWW pages. This includes
number of powerful new features, such as the ability to set variables
and use conditional HTML.

<li><b><a href="files.html">File-based and Regex-enabled Directive
Sections</a></b><br>
The new <code>&lt;Files&gt;</code> section allows directives to be
enabled based on full filename, not just directory and URL. In
addition, <code>&lt;Files&gt;</code> sections can appear in
<code>.htaccess</code> files. <code>&lt;Files&gt;</code>, along with
<code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Location&gt;</code>, can
also now be based on regular expressions, not just simple prefix
matching. 

<li><b><a href="mod/mod_browser.html">Browser-based Environment
Variables</a></b><br>
Environment variables can now be set based on the
<code>User-Agent</code> string of the browser. Combined with <a
href="xssi.html">XSSI</a>, this allows you to write browser-based
conditional HTML documents.

<li><b><a href="sucgi.html">SetUID CGI Execution</a></b>
    Apache now
    supports the execution of CGI scripts as users other
    than the server user. A number of security checks are built in
    to try and make this as safe as possible.

<li><b><a href="mod/mod_rewrite.html">URL Rewriting Module</a></b><br>
The optional <code>mod_rewrite</code> module is now included. This
module can provide powerful URL mapping, using regular
expressions. There's nothing this module can't do!

<li><b><a href="mod_fastcgi.html">Optional FastCGI Module Included</a></b><br>
FastCGI is a high-performance alternative to CGI. FastCGI gets its speed by having the Web server keep the
application processes running between requests. So, unlike CGI, you do not have the overhead of starting up
a new process and doing application initialization (e.g. connecting to a database) each time somebody requests
a document. The processes start up with the Web server and keep on running.

<li><b><a href="mod/mod_headers.html">Optional Headers Module to Set or Remove HTTP Headers</a></b><br>
The optional <code>mod_headers</code> header can be used to set custom
headers in the HTTP response. It can append to existing headers,
replace them, or remove headers from the response.

<li><b><a href="mod/mod_log_config.html">Enhanced, Configurable
Logging</a></b><br>
The optional <code>mod_log_config</code> included with earlier
versions of Apache is now standard, and has been enhanced to allow
logging of much more detail about the transaction, and can be used to
open more than one log at once (each of which can have a different log
format).

<li><b><a href="mod/mod_usertrack.html">User Tracking (Cookies)
Revisions</a></b><br>
The <code>mod_cookies</code> included with previous versions of Apache
has been renamed <code>mod_usertrack</code>, to more accurately
reflect its function (some people inadvertantely thought it enabled
cookie support in Apache, which is not true - Apache supports the use
of cookies directly). It is also now possible to disable the
generation of cookies, even when
    the cookie module is compiled in. Also, an expiry time can be set
    on the cookies.

<li><b><a href="multi_ip.html">Multiple IPs in &lt;VirtualHost&gt;</a></b><br>
    The &lt;VirtualHost&gt; directive can now take more than one IP
    address or hostname. This lets a single vhost handles requests
    for multiple IPs or hostnames.

<li><b><a href="cgi_debug.html">CGI Debugging Environment</a></b><br>
<code>ScriptLog</code> allows you to now set up a log that records
all input and output to failed CGI scripts. This includes environment
variables, input headers, POST data, output, and more. This makes CGI
scripts much easier to debug.

<li><b><a href="rlimit.html">Resource Limits for CGI Scripts</a></b><br>
New directives allow the limiting of resources used by CGI scripts
(e.g. max CPU time). This is helpful in preventing 'runaway' CGI
processes.

<li><b><a href="mod/mod_alias.html">Redirect Directive Can Returns Additional Statuses</a></b><br>
    The Redirect directive can return permanent or temporary redirectes,
    "Gone" or "See Other" HTTP statuses. For NCSA-compatability, 
    RedirectTemp and RedirectPermanent are also implemented.

<li><b><a href="graceful.html">Graceful Restarts</a></b><br>
    Apache can re-read the config files and re-open log files without
    terminating transactions in progress.

<li><b><a href="Configure.html">Simplified Compliation</a></b><br>
    The process of configuring Apache for compilation has been
    simplified.

<li><b><a href="help.html">Command-line Help</a></b><br>
The <code>-h</code> command-line option now lists all the available
directives.

<li><b><a href="mod/mod_headers.html">Optional headers module</a></b><br>
An optional module is included which can set arbitrary headers in responses.

<li><b><a href="ifmod.html">Conditional Config Directives</a></b><br>
A new <code>&lt;IfModule&gt;</code> section allows directives to be
enabled only if a given module is loaded into the server.

<li><b><a href="ncsa_auth.html">Authorization Directives Now Use
NCSA-style Syntax</a></b><br>
The AuthUserFile, AuthGroupFile and AuthDigestFile commands now have a syntax
compatible with the NCSA server.

<li><b><a href="mod/mod_proxy.html">Optional proxy module</a></b><br>
An improved FTP, HTTP, and CONNECT mode SSL proxy is included with
Apache 1.2. Some of the changes visible to users:
	<dl><dl>
	<dt>- Improved FTP proxy supporting PASV mode
	<dt>- NoProxy directive for excluding sites to proxy
	<dt>- CONNECT mode ports are configurable from a list
	<dt>- NoCache * directive for disabling proxy caching
	<dt>- Numerous bug fixes
	</dl></dl>
