<h2>New Features with Apache 1.3</h2>
<p>New features with this release, as extensions of the Apache
functionality. Because the core code has changed so
significantly, there are certain liberties that earlier versions of
Apache (and the NCSA daemon) took that recent Apache versions are
pickier about - please check the 
<a href="misc/compat_notes.html">compatibility notes</a> if you have any
problems.</p>
<hr>

<p>In addition to a number of bug fixes and internal performance
enhancements, <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/">Apache
1.2</a> has the following specific new user features:</p>

<ul>

<li><b><a href="nt.html">Support for Windows NT/95</a></b>
[Documentation to be written]<br>

Apache now supports the Windows NT and Windows 95 operating systems,
as well as the Unix systems supported in previos releases. Although the
Windows version of Apache may not be perform as well as on the Unix
systems for which Apache was originally written, the ability to run on
Windows gives Apache the ability to run on a large number of web
servers it was not previously able to.
