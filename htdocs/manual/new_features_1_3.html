<h2>New Features with Apache 1.3</h2>
<p>New features with this release, as extensions of the Apache
functionality. Because the core code has changed so
significantly, there are certain liberties that earlier versions of
Apache (and the NCSA daemon) took that recent Apache versions are
pickier about - please check the
<a href="misc/compat_notes.html">compatibility notes</a> if you have any
problems.</p>
<hr>

<p>In addition to a number of bug fixes and internal performance
enhancements, <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/">Apache
1.3</a> has the following specific new user features:</p>

<ul>
 <LI><A
      HREF="mod/mod_speling.html"
     ><STRONG>Optional &laquo;Spelling Correction&raquo; module added to distribution</STRONG></A>
  <BR>
  This optional module corrects frequently occurring spelling errors in
  document names requested from the server. This includes the correction
  of miscapitalized requests (as was available in a separately available
  <EM>mod_speling</EM> module as of Apache 1.1 already) but extends
  spelling correction to single inserted, omitted, transposed or
  mistyped characters. This catches the majority of mistyped requests.
  To make use of this module, it must be enabled in the server's
  <CODE>Configuration</CODE> file, and the
  <CODE><A HREF="mod/mod_speling.html#checkspelling">CheckSpelling</A></CODE>
  directive must be set to <CODE>on</CODE>.
 </LI>
 <LI><A
      HREF="mod/mod_setenvif.html"
     ><STRONG>Enhanced Conditional Setting of Environment Variables</STRONG></A>
  <BR>
  The
  <A
   HREF="mod/mod_setenvif.html#BrowserMatch"
  ><SAMP>BrowserMatch*</SAMP></A>
  directives of Apache 1.2 have been joined by some more powerful
  brethren:
  <A
   HREF="mod/mod_setenvif.html#SetEnvIf"
  ><SAMP>SetEnvIf</SAMP></A>
  and
  <A
   HREF="mod/mod_setenvif.html#SetEnvIfNoCase"
  ><SAMP>SetEnvIfNoCase</SAMP></A>.  These allow you to set environment
  variables for server and CGI use based upon all <EM>sorts</EM> of
  attributes of the request.
 </LI>
 <LI><STRONG>Better Logging for Proxy Connect Errors</STRONG>
  <BR>
  In Apache 1.2 and earlier, when the proxy had difficulty connecting to
  a system it would log the error but no details.  It now includes the
  IP address and port to which it couldn't connect.
 </LI>
 <LI><A
      HREF="mod/mod_include.html#flowctrl"
     ><STRONG>Enhanced SSI String Comparisons</STRONG></A>
  <BR>
  The string-based server-side include (SSI) flow-control directives
  provided by
  <A
   HREF="mod/mod_include.html"
  ><SAMP>mod_include</SAMP></A>
  now include comparison for less-than (&lt;), less-than-or-equal
  (&lt;=), greater-than (&gt;), and greater-than-or-equal (&gt;=).
  Previously comparisons could only be made for equality or inequality.
 </LI>
<LI><A
     HREF="sourcereorg.html"
    ><STRONG>Re-organised Sources</STRONG></A>
 <BR>
 The source files for Apache have been re-organised. The main difference
 for Apache users is that the "Module" lines in <CODE>Configuration</CODE>
 have been replaced with "AddModule" with a slightly different syntax.
 For module authors there are some changes designed to make it
 easier for users to add their module.
</LI>
<LI><A
     HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html"
    ><STRONG>Sortable Directory Listings</STRONG></A>
 <BR>
 If a directory listing is displayed using
 <A
  HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions"
 >FancyIndexing</A>,
 clicking on a column title will now sort the listing in
 order by the values in that column.  Selecting the column
 repeatedly will toggle between ascending and descending order.
</LI>
<LI><A
     HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions"
    ><STRONG><SAMP>SuppressHTMLPreamble</SAMP> Option for
    FancyIndexed Directories</STRONG></A>
 <BR>
 If a directory is marked for display with FancyIndexing, the listing
 page usually follows a predefined format using server-generated HTML.
 <STRONG>If</STRONG> the IndexOptions directive for the directory
 includes the <SAMP>SuppressHTMLPreamble</SAMP> option,
 <STRONG>and</STRONG> a file specified by the
 <A
  HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#headername"
 >HeaderName</A>
 directive is found in the directory, <STRONG>and</STRONG> the header
 file is recognized as containing HTML (determined by the file
 extension), <STRONG>then</STRONG> the module will assume that the
 header file contains the necessary introductory HTML tags and will not
 generate them itself.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Less Buffering of CGI Script Output</STRONG>
 <BR>
 In previous versions of Apache, the output from CGI scripts would be
 internally buffered by the server, and wouldn't be forwarded to the
 client until either the buffers were full or the CGI script completed.
 As of Apache 1.3, the buffer to the client is flushed any time it
 contains something and the server is waiting for more information from
 the script.  This allows CGI script to provide partial status reports
 during long processing operations.
</LI>
<li><b><a href="windows.html">Support for Windows NT/95</a></b><br>
Apache now supports the Windows NT and Windows 95 operating systems,
as well as the Unix systems supported in previos releases. Although the
Windows version of Apache may not be perform as well as on the Unix
systems for which Apache was originally written, the ability to run on
Windows gives Apache the ability to run on a large number of web
servers it was not previously able to.

<li><b><a href="mod/mod_alias.html">Regular Expression support for Alias
and Redirect</a></b>
<br>
New <code><a href="mod/mod_alias.html#aliasmatch">AliasMatch</a></code>,
<code><a
href="mod/mod_alias.html#scriptaliasmatch">ScriptAliasMatch</a></code>, and
<code><a
href="mod/mod_alias.html#redirectmatch">RedirectMatch</a></code>
directives allow for the use of regular expression matching.
Additionally, new
<code><a href="mod_core.html#directorymatch">&lt;DirectoryMatch&gt;</a></code>,
<code><a href="mod_core.html#locationmatch">&lt;LocationMatch&gt;</a></code>,
and <code><a href="mod_core.html#filesmatch">&lt;FilesMatch&gt;</a></code>
sections provide a new syntax for regular expression sectioning.

<li><strong><a href="mod/mod_mime_magic.html">New "Magic" MIME-typing
    module</a></strong><br>
    A new module, the optional <code>mod_mime_magic</code>, has been
    added. It uses "magic numbers" and other hints from a file's contents
    to figure out what the contents are. It then uses this information to
    set the file's media type, if it cannot be determined by the file's
    extension.

<li><strong>Directory indexing modules split</strong><br>
    The <code>mod_dir</code> module has been split in two, with
    <a href="mod/mod_dir.html">mod_dir</a> handling directory index
    files, and <a href="mod/mod_autoindex.html">mod_autoindex</a>
    creating directory listings.

 <LI><STRONG>Support for Directory Icon Sizing</STRONG>
  <BR>
  The
  <A
   HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html"
  ><SAMP>mod_autoindex</SAMP></A>
  module provides listings of directory contents when appropriate.  If
  the <SAMP>FancyIndexing</SAMP> option is enabled, each file in the
  list is preceded by an icon representing the content type.  In earlier
  versions of Apache, the HTML <SAMP>IMG</SAMP> tags for these icons
  weren't sized, so the browser had to wait until the images were loaded
  before it could lay out the page.  With 1.3, the
  <A
   HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions"
  ><SAMP>IndexOptions</SAMP></A>
  directive has two new keywords which allow you to control whether
  pre-sized <SAMP>IMG</SAMP> tags are used.  This can substantially
  speed up the display of large directory listings.

<li><strong><a href="mod/core.html#accessfilename">AccessFileName
Enhancement</a></strong><br>
The &lt;AccessFileName&gt; directive can now take more than one
filename. This lets sites serving pages from network file systems and
more than one Apache web server, configure access based on the server
through which shared pages are being served.

<li><strong>HostNameLookups now defaults to "Off"</strong><br>
    The <a href="mod/core.html#hostnamelookups">HostNameLookups</a>
    directive now defaults to "Off". This means that, unless explictly
    turned on, the server will not resolve IP addresses into names. This
    was done to spare the Internet from unneccessary DNS traffic.

<li><strong>Double-Reverse DNS enforced</strong><br>
    The <a href="mod/core.html#hostnamelookups">HostnameLookups</a> directive
    now supports double-reverse DNS.  (Known as <i>PARANOID</i> in the
    terminology of tcp_wrappers.)  An IP address passes a double-reverse
    DNS test if the forward map of the reverse map includes the original
    IP.  Regardless of the HostnameLookups setting,
    <a href="mod/mod_access.html">mod_access</a> access lists using DNS
    names <b>require</b> all names to pass a double-reverse DNS test.

<li><strong>CIDR and Netmask access control</strong><br>
    <a href="mod/mod_access.html">mod_access</a> directives now support
    CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) style prefixes, and netmasks for
    greater control over IP access lists.

<li><strong>New child_init function for module API</strong><br>
A new phase for Apache's API is called once per "heavy-weight process,"
before any requests are handled. This allows the module to set up
anything that need to be done once per processes. For example,
connections to databases.

<li><strong><a href="mod/mod_proxy.html#noproxy">NoProxy</a></strong>
and <strong><a href="mod/mod_proxy.html#proxydomain">ProxyDomain</a>
</strong> directives added to proxy, useful for intranets.
    
<li><strong><a href="mod/mod_info.html#addmoduleinfo">AddModuleInfo</a>
directive added to <a href="mod/mod_info.html">mod_info</a></strong><br>
Allows additional information to be listed along with a specified module.

<li><strong>Performance Improvements</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>IP-based virtual hosts are looked up via hash table,
	giving a performance boost on servers with large numbers of vhosts.
    <li>&lt;Directory&gt; parsing of requests has been vastly improved, giving
	speedups on configs with a lot of sections.
    <li>The critical path for static requests has fewer system calls.  This
	generally helps all requests.  (45 syscalls for a static request
	in 1.2 versus 22 in 1.3 in a well tuned configuration).
    <li><a href="mod/mod_proxy.html#ReceiveBufferSize">ReceiveBufferSize</a>
	directive gives mod_proxy's outgoing connections larger network
	buffers, for increased throughput.
    <li>The low level i/o routines use <code>writev</code> (where available)
	to issue multiple writes with a single system call.  They also avoid
	copying memory into buffers as much as possible.  The result is
	less CPU time spent on transferring large files.
    <li>Static requests are served using
	<code>mmap</code>, which means bytes are only copied from the
	disk buffer to the network buffer directly by the kernel.  The
	program never copies bytes around, which reduces CPU time.
    <li>When presented with a load spike, the server quickly adapts by
	spawning children at faster rates.
    <li>The code which dispatches modules was optimized to avoid repeatedly
	skipping over modules that don't implement certain phases of the
	API.  (This skipping showed up as 5% of the cpu time on profiles of
	a server with the default module mix.)
    <li>Revamp of the Unix scoreboard management code so that less time is
	spent counting children in various states.  Previously a scan was
	performed for each hit, now it is performed only once per second.
	This should be noticeable on servers running with hundreds of
	children and high loads.
    <li>New serialization choices improve performance on Linux, Solaris,
	and IRIX.
    </ul>

<li><strong>Unique Identifiers</strong><br>
    mod_unique_id can be included to generate a unique identifier that
    distinguishes a hit from every other hit.  ("Unique" has
    some restrictions on it.)  Documentation to be written.  The
    identifier is available in the environment variable
    <code>UNIQUE_ID</code>.

<li><strong>Reliable Piped Logs</strong><br>
    On almost all Unix architectures Apache now implements "reliable"
    piped logs in <a href="mod/mod_log_config.html">mod_log_config</a>.
    Where reliable means that if the logging child dies for whatever
    reason, Apache will recover and respawn it without having to restart
    the entire server.  Furthermore if the logging child becomes "stuck"
    and isn't reading its pipe frequently enough Apache will also restart
    it.  This opens up more opportunities for log rotation, hit filtering,
    real-time splitting of multiple vhosts into separate logs, and
    asynchronous DNS resolving on the fly.
