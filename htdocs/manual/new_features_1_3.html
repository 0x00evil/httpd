<H2>New Features with Apache 1.3</H2>
<P>New features with this release, as extensions of the Apache
functionality. Because the core code has changed so
significantly, there are certain liberties that earlier versions of
Apache (and the NCSA daemon) took that recent Apache versions are
pickier about - please check the
<A HREF="misc/compat_notes.html">compatibility notes</A> if you have any
problems.</P>
<P>If you're upgrading from Apache 1.2, you may wish to read
the <A HREF="upgrading_to_1_3.html">upgrade notes</A>.</P>
<HR>

<P>In addition to a number of bug fixes and internal performance
enhancements, <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/dist/">Apache
1.3</A> has the following specific new user features:</P>

<UL>
 <LI><A
      HREF="mod/mod_speling.html"
     ><STRONG>Optional &laquo;Spelling Correction&raquo; module added to distribution</STRONG></A>
  <BR>
  This optional module corrects frequently occurring spelling errors in
  document names requested from the server. This includes the correction
  of miscapitalized requests (as was available in a separately available
  <EM>mod_speling</EM> module as of Apache 1.1 already) but extends
  spelling correction to single inserted, omitted, transposed or
  mistyped characters. This catches the majority of mistyped requests.
  To make use of this module, it must be enabled in the server's
  <CODE>Configuration</CODE> file, and the
  <A HREF="mod/mod_speling.html#checkspelling"><SAMP>CheckSpelling</SAMP></A>
  directive must be set to <CODE>on</CODE>.
 </LI>
 <LI><A
      HREF="mod/mod_setenvif.html"
     ><STRONG>Enhanced Conditional Setting of Environment Variables</STRONG></A>
  <BR>
  The
  <A
   HREF="mod/mod_setenvif.html#BrowserMatch"
  ><SAMP>BrowserMatch*</SAMP></A>
  directives of Apache 1.2 have been joined by some more powerful
  brethren:
  <A
   HREF="mod/mod_setenvif.html#SetEnvIf"
  ><SAMP>SetEnvIf</SAMP></A>
  and
  <A
   HREF="mod/mod_setenvif.html#SetEnvIfNoCase"
  ><SAMP>SetEnvIfNoCase</SAMP></A>.  These allow you to set environment
  variables for server and CGI use based upon all <EM>sorts</EM> of
  attributes of the request.
 </LI>
 <LI><STRONG>Easier navigation in ftp server directory trees</STRONG>
  <BR>
  When accessing ftp servers using mod_proxy and the ftp method, the
  generated directory listings now allow easier navigation. The full
  directory path as shown in the header line now consists of a list of
  clickable links which directly jump to the selected subdirectory level.
 </LI>
 <LI><STRONG>Better Logging for Proxy Connect Errors</STRONG>
  <BR>
  In Apache 1.2 and earlier, when the proxy had difficulty connecting to
  a system it would log the error but no details.  It now includes the
  IP address and port to which it couldn't connect.
 </LI>
 <LI><A
      HREF="mod/mod_include.html#flowctrl"
     ><STRONG>Enhanced SSI String Comparisons</STRONG></A>
  <BR>
  The string-based server-side include (SSI) flow-control directives
  provided by
  <A
   HREF="mod/mod_include.html"
  ><SAMP>mod_include</SAMP></A>
  now include comparison for less-than (&lt;), less-than-or-equal
  (&lt;=), greater-than (&gt;), and greater-than-or-equal (&gt;=).
  Previously comparisons could only be made for equality or inequality.
 </LI>
<LI><A
     HREF="sourcereorg.html"
    ><STRONG>Re-organised Sources</STRONG></A>
 <BR>
 The source files for Apache have been re-organised. The main difference
 for Apache users is that the "Module" lines in <CODE>Configuration</CODE>
 have been replaced with "AddModule" with a slightly different syntax.
 For module authors there are some changes designed to make it
 easier for users to add their module.
</LI>
<LI><A
     HREF="install.html#install"
    ><STRONG>Default Apache directory path changed to <SAMP>/usr/local/apache/</SAMP></STRONG></A>
 <BR>
 The default directory for the apache ServerRoot changed from the NCSA-compatible
 <SAMP>/usr/local/etc/httpd/</SAMP> to <SAMP>/usr/local/apache/</SAMP>.
 This change covers only the default setting (and the documentation); it
 is of course possible to override it using the <A HREF="invoking.html">
 -d <EM>ServerRoot</EM> and -f <EM>httpd.conf</EM></A> switches when starting apache.
</LI>
<LI><A
     HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html"
    ><STRONG>Sortable Directory Listings</STRONG></A>
 <BR>
 If a directory listing is displayed using
 <A
  HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions"
 ><SAMP>FancyIndexing</SAMP></A>,
 clicking on a column title will now sort the listing in
 order by the values in that column.  Selecting the column
 repeatedly will toggle between ascending and descending order.
 This feature can be disabled with the <SAMP>SuppressColumnSorting</SAMP>
 <A
  HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions"
 >IndexOptions</A>
 keyword.
</LI>
<LI><A
     HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions"
    ><STRONG><SAMP>SuppressHTMLPreamble</SAMP> Option for
    FancyIndexed Directories</STRONG></A>
 <BR>
 If a directory is marked for display with FancyIndexing, the listing
 page usually follows a predefined format using server-generated HTML.
 <STRONG>If</STRONG> the <SAMP>IndexOptions</SAMP> directive for the directory
 includes the <SAMP>SuppressHTMLPreamble</SAMP> option,
 <STRONG>and</STRONG> a file specified by the
 <A
  HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#headername"
 ><SAMP>HeaderName</SAMP></A>
 directive is found in the directory, <STRONG>and</STRONG> the header
 file is recognized as containing HTML (determined by the file
 extension), <STRONG>then</STRONG> the module will assume that the
 header file contains the necessary introductory HTML tags and will not
 generate them itself.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Less Buffering of CGI Script Output</STRONG>
 <BR>
 In previous versions of Apache, the output from CGI scripts would be
 internally buffered by the server, and wouldn't be forwarded to the
 client until either the buffers were full or the CGI script completed.
 As of Apache 1.3, the buffer to the client is flushed any time it
 contains something and the server is waiting for more information from
 the script.  This allows CGI script to provide partial status reports
 during long processing operations.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A HREF="windows.html">Support for Windows NT/95</A></STRONG><BR>
Apache now supports the Windows NT and Windows 95 operating systems,
as well as the Unix systems supported in previous releases. Although the
Windows version of Apache may not be perform as well as on the Unix
systems for which Apache was originally written, the ability to run on
Windows gives Apache the ability to run on a large number of web
servers it was not previously able to.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A HREF="ebcdic.html">Port to EBCDIC mainframe machine running BS2000/OSD</A></STRONG><BR>
As a premiere, this version of Apache comes with a beta version of a port
to a mainframe machine which uses the EBCDIC character set as its native
codeset (It is the SIEMENS NIXDORF family of mainframes running the
BS2000/OSD operating system on a IBM/390 compatible processor
This mainframe OS nowadays features a SVR4-like POSIX subsystem).<BR>
Provisions to convert between EBCDIC documents and the ASCII encoded
HTTP protocol have been integrated into Apache, and most of
the provided Apache modules have been ported to this platform.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_alias.html">Regular Expression support for
<SAMP>Alias</SAMP> and <SAMP>Redirect</SAMP></A></STRONG>
<BR>
New <A HREF="mod/mod_alias.html#aliasmatch"><SAMP>AliasMatch</SAMP></A>,
<A HREF="mod/mod_alias.html#scriptaliasmatch"
><SAMP>ScriptAliasMatch</SAMP></A>, and
<A HREF="mod/mod_alias.html#redirectmatch"><SAMP>RedirectMatch</SAMP></A>
directives allow for the use of regular expression matching.
Additionally, new
<A HREF="mod/core.html#directorymatch"><SAMP>&lt;DirectoryMatch&gt;</SAMP></A>,
<A HREF="mod/core.html#locationmatch"><SAMP>&lt;LocationMatch&gt;</SAMP></A>,
and
<A HREF="mod/core.html#filesmatch"><SAMP>&lt;FilesMatch&gt;</SAMP></A>
sections provide a new syntax for regular expression sectioning.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_mime_magic.html">New "Magic" MIME-typing
    module</A></STRONG><BR>
    A new module, the optional <CODE>mod_mime_magic</CODE>, has been
    added. It uses "magic numbers" and other hints from a file's contents
    to figure out what the contents are. It then uses this information to
    set the file's media type, if it cannot be determined by the file's
    extension.

<LI><STRONG>Directory indexing modules split</STRONG><BR>
    The <CODE>mod_dir</CODE> module has been split in two, with
    <A HREF="mod/mod_dir.html">mod_dir</A> handling directory index
    files, and <A HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html">mod_autoindex</A>
    creating directory listings.  Thus allowing folks to remove
    the indexing function from critical servers.

 <LI><STRONG>Support for Directory Icon Sizing</STRONG>
  <BR>
  The
  <A
   HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html"
  ><SAMP>mod_autoindex</SAMP></A>
  module provides listings of directory contents when appropriate.  If
  the <SAMP>FancyIndexing</SAMP> option is enabled, each file in the
  list is preceded by an icon representing the content type.  In earlier
  versions of Apache, the HTML <SAMP>IMG</SAMP> tags for these icons
  weren't sized, so the browser had to wait until the images were loaded
  before it could lay out the page.  With 1.3, the
  <A
   HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions"
  ><SAMP>IndexOptions</SAMP></A>
  directive has two new keywords which allow you to control whether
  pre-sized <SAMP>IMG</SAMP> tags are used.  This can substantially
  speed up the display of large directory listings.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/core.html#accessfilename"><SAMP>AccessFileName</SAMP>
Enhancement</A></STRONG><BR>
The <SAMP>AccessFileName</SAMP> directive can now take more than one
filename. This lets sites serving pages from network file systems and
more than one Apache web server, configure access based on the server
through which shared pages are being served.

<LI><STRONG><SAMP>HostNameLookups</SAMP> now defaults to "Off"</STRONG><BR>
    The <A
    HREF="mod/core.html#hostnamelookups"><SAMP>HostNameLookups</SAMP></A>
    directive now defaults to "Off". This means that, unless explicitly
    turned on, the server will not resolve IP addresses into names. This
    was done to spare the Internet from unnecessary DNS traffic.

<LI><STRONG>Double-Reverse DNS enforced</STRONG><BR>
    The
    <A HREF="mod/core.html#hostnamelookups"><SAMP>HostnameLookups</SAMP></A>
    directive  
    now supports double-reverse DNS.  (Known as <EM>PARANOID</EM> in the
    terminology of tcp_wrappers.)  An IP address passes a double-reverse
    DNS test if the forward map of the reverse map includes the original
    IP.  Regardless of the HostnameLookups setting,
    <A HREF="mod/mod_access.html">mod_access</A> access lists using DNS
    names <STRONG>require</STRONG> all names to pass a double-reverse DNS test.
    (Prior versions of Apache required a compile-time switch to enable
    double-reverse DNS.)

<LI><STRONG>CIDR and Netmask access control</STRONG><BR>
    <A HREF="mod/mod_access.html">mod_access</A> directives now support
    CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) style prefixes, and netmasks for
    greater control over IP access lists.

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_proxy.html#noproxy"><SAMP>NoProxy</SAMP></A>
and <A HREF="mod/mod_proxy.html#proxydomain"><SAMP>ProxyDomain</SAMP></A>
directives added to proxy, useful for intranets.</STRONG>
    
<LI><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_info.html#addmoduleinfo"
><SAMP>AddModuleInfo</SAMP></A>
directive added to <A HREF="mod/mod_info.html">mod_info</A></STRONG><BR>
Allows additional information to be listed along with a specified module.

<LI><STRONG>Experimental module to load modules at runtime on Unix</STRONG><BR>
    The new module <SAMP><A HREF="mod/mod_so.html">mod_so</A></SAMP>
    enables the addition of modules when Apache is started, rather
    than requiring a recompilation.  This is currently experimental,
    and replaces the old <SAMP>mod_dld</SAMP> module.

<LI><STRONG>Performance Improvements</STRONG>
    <UL>
    <LI>IP-based virtual hosts are looked up via hash table,
	giving a performance boost on servers with large numbers of vhosts.
    <LI>&lt;Directory&gt; parsing of requests has been vastly improved, giving
	speedups on configs with a lot of sections.
    <LI>The critical path for static requests has fewer system calls.  This
	generally helps all requests.  (45 syscalls for a static request
	in 1.2 versus 22 in 1.3 in a well tuned configuration).
    <LI><A HREF="mod/mod_proxy.html#proxyreceivebuffersize"
        ><SAMP>ProxyReceiveBufferSize</SAMP></A>
	directive gives <CODE>mod_proxy</CODE>'s outgoing connections
	larger network buffers, for increased throughput.
    <LI>The low level I/O routines use <CODE>writev</CODE> (where available)
	to issue multiple writes with a single system call.  They also avoid
	copying memory into buffers as much as possible.  The result is
	less CPU time spent on transferring large files.
    <LI>Static requests are served using
	<CODE>mmap</CODE>, which means bytes are only copied from the
	disk buffer to the network buffer directly by the kernel.  The
	program never copies bytes around, which reduces CPU time.
	(Only where available/tested.)
    <LI>When presented with a load spike, the server quickly adapts by
	spawning children at faster rates.
    <LI>The code which dispatches modules was optimized to avoid repeatedly
	skipping over modules that don't implement certain phases of the
	API.  (This skipping showed up as 5% of the cpu time on profiles of
	a server with the default module mix.)
    <LI>Revamp of the Unix scoreboard management code so that less time is
	spent counting children in various states.  Previously a scan was
	performed for each hit, now it is performed only once per second.
	This should be noticeable on servers running with hundreds of
	children and high loads.
    <LI>New serialization choices improve performance on Linux, and IRIX.
    <LI><CODE><A HREF="mod/mod_log_config.html">mod_log_config</A></CODE>
	can be compile-time configured to buffer writes.
    <LI>Replaced <CODE>strncpy()</CODE> with <CODE>ap_cpystrn()</CODE>, a
	routine which doesn't have to zero-fill the entire result.  This
	has dramatic effects on <CODE>mod_include</CODE> speed.
    <LI>Additions to the internal "table" API (used for keeping lists of
	key/value string pairs) provide for up to 20% performance
	improvement in many situations.
    </UL>

    <P>See <A HREF="misc/perf-tuning.html">the new performance
    documentation</A> for more information.

<LI><STRONG>Unique Identifiers</STRONG><BR>
    <A HREF="mod/mod_unique_id.html">mod_unique_id</A> can be included
    to generate a unique identifier that distinguishes a hit from every
    other hit.  ("Unique" has some restrictions on it.)  The identifier
    is available in the environment variable <CODE>UNIQUE_ID</CODE>.

<LI><STRONG>Reliable Piped Logs</STRONG><BR>
    On almost all Unix architectures Apache now implements "reliable"
    piped logs in <A HREF="mod/mod_log_config.html">mod_log_config</A>.
    Where reliable means that if the logging child dies for whatever
    reason, Apache will recover and respawn it without having to restart
    the entire server.  Furthermore if the logging child becomes "stuck"
    and isn't reading its pipe frequently enough Apache will also restart
    it.  This opens up more opportunities for log rotation, hit filtering,
    real-time splitting of multiple vhosts into separate logs, and
    asynchronous DNS resolving on the fly.

<LI><STRONG>ServerRoot relative auth filenames</STRONG><BR>
    Auth filenames for the various authentication modules are now treated
    as relative to the ServerRoot if they are not full paths.

<LI><STRONG><SAMP>Include</SAMP> directive</STRONG><BR>
    The
    <A
     HREF="mod/core.html#include"
    ><SAMP>Include</SAMP></A>
    directive includes other config files immediately at that
    point in parsing.

<LI><STRONG>Absence of any <SAMP>TransferLog</SAMP> disables logging</STRONG>
    <BR>
    If no <A HREF="mod/mod_log_config.html#transferlog"
    ><SAMP>TransferLog</SAMP></A>
    directive is given then no log is written.  This supports co-existence
    with other logging modules.
<LI><STRONG>Ability to name logging formats</STRONG>
 <BR>
 The
 <A
  HREF="mod/mod_log_config.html#logformat"
 ><SAMP>LogFormat</SAMP></A>
 directive has been enhanced to allow you to give nicknames to
 specific logging formats.  You can then use these nicknames in other
 <SAMP>LogFormat</SAMP>
 and
 <A
  HREF="mod/mod_log_config.html#customlog"
 ><SAMP>CustomLog</SAMP></A>
 directives, rather than having to spell out the complete log format
 string each time.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>mod_cern_meta configurable per-directory</STRONG><BR>
    <A HREF="mod/mod_cern_meta.html">mod_cern_meta</A> is now configurable
    on a per-directory basis.

<LI><STRONG>Detaching from stdin/out/err</STRONG><BR>
    On boot Apache will now detach from stdin, stdout, and stderr.  It
    does not detach from stderr until it has successfully read the config
    files.  So you will see errors in the config file.  This should make
    it easier to start Apache via rsh or crontab.

<LI><STRONG>Improved HTTP/1.1-style Virtual Hosts</STRONG><BR>
    The new
    <A HREF="mod/core.html#namevirtualhost"><SAMP>NameVirtualHost</SAMP></A>
    directive is used to list IP address:port 
    pairs on which HTTP/1.1-style virtual hosting occurs.  This is
    vhosting based on the <CODE>Host:</CODE> header from the client.
    Previously this address was implicitly the same as the "main address"
    of the machine, and this caused no end of problems for users, and
    was not powerful enough.
    Please see the <A HREF="vhosts/index.html">Apache Virtual Host
    documentation</A> for further details on configuration.

<LI><STRONG>API Additions</STRONG><BR>
    
    For all those module writers and code hackers:

    <UL>
    <LI><STRONG><CODE>child_init</CODE> function for module API</STRONG><BR>
    A new phase for Apache's API is called once per "heavy-weight process,"
    before any requests are handled. This allows the module to set up
    anything that need to be done once per processes. For example,
    connections to databases.

    <LI><STRONG><CODE>child_exit</CODE> function for module API</STRONG><BR>
    A new phase called once per "heavy-weight process," when it is
    terminating.  Note that it can't be called in some fatal cases (such
    as segfaults and kill -9).  The <CODE>child_init</CODE> and
    <CODE>child_exit</CODE> functions are passed a pool whose lifetime is
    the same as the lifetime of the child (modulo completely fatal
    events in which apache has no hope of recovering).  In contrast,
    the module <CODE>init</CODE> function is passed a pool whose lifetime
    ends when the parent exits or restarts.

    <LI><STRONG><CODE>child_terminate</CODE></STRONG><BR>
    Used in the child to indicate the child should exit after finishing
    the current request.

    <LI><STRONG><CODE>register_other_child</CODE></STRONG><BR>
    See <CODE>http_main.h</CODE>.  This is used in the parent to register
    a child for monitoring.  The parent will report status to a supplied
    callback function.  This allows modules to create their own children
    which are monitored along with the httpd children.

    <LI><STRONG><CODE>piped_log</CODE></STRONG><BR>
    See <CODE>http_log.h</CODE>.  This API provides the common code for
    implementing piped logs.  In particular it implements a reliable piped
    log on architectures supporting it (<EM>i.e.</EM>, Unix at the moment).

    <LI><STRONG>MD5 functions renamed <CODE>ap_*</CODE></STRONG><BR>
    MD5 functions renamed to avoid conflicts with other libraries.

    <LI><STRONG>scoreboard format changed</STRONG><BR>
    The scoreboard format is quite different.  It is considered a
    "private" interface in general, so it's only mentioned here as an FYI.

    <LI><STRONG><CODE>set_last_modified</CODE> split into three</STRONG><BR>
    The old function <CODE>set_last_modified</CODE> performed multiple
    jobs including the setting of the <CODE>Last-Modified</CODE> header, the
    <CODE>ETag</CODE> header, and processing conditional requests (such as
    IMS).  These functions have been split into three functions:
    <CODE>set_last_modified</CODE>, <CODE>set_etag</CODE>, and
    <CODE>meets_conditions</CODE>.  The field <CODE>mtime</CODE> has been
    added to <CODE>request_rec</CODE> to facilitate
    <CODE>meets_conditions</CODE>.

    <LI><STRONG>New error logging function: <CODE>aplog_error</CODE></STRONG><BR>
    All old logging functions are deprecated, we are in the process of
    replacing them with a single function called <CODE>aplog_error</CODE>.
    This is still a work in progress.

    <LI><STRONG><CODE>set_file_slot</CODE> for config parsing</STRONG><BR>
    The <CODE>set_file_slot</CODE> routine provides a standard routine that
    prepends ServerRoot to non-absolute paths.

    <LI><STRONG><CODE>post_read_request</CODE> module API</STRONG><BR>
    This request phase occurs immediately after reading the request (headers),
    and immediately after creating an internal redirect.  It is most useful
    for setting environment variables to affect future phases.

    <LI><STRONG><CODE>psocket</CODE>, and <CODE>popendir</CODE></STRONG><BR>
    The <CODE>psocket</CODE> and <CODE>pclosesocket</CODE> functions allow
    for race-condition free socket creation with resource tracking.
    Similarly <CODE>popendir</CODE> and <CODE>pclosedir</CODE> protect
    directory reading.

    <LI><STRONG><CODE>is_initial_req</CODE></STRONG><BR>
    Test if the request is the initial request (<EM>i.e.</EM>, the one
    coming from the client).

    <LI><STRONG><CODE>kill_only_once</CODE></STRONG><BR>
    An option to <CODE>spawn_child</CODE> functions which prevents Apache
    from aggressively trying to kill off the child.

    <LI><STRONG><CODE>alloc debugging code</CODE></STRONG><BR>
    Defining <CODE>ALLOC_DEBUG</CODE> provides a rudimentary memory
    debugger which can be used on live servers with low impact --
    it sets all allocated and freed memory bytes to 0xa5.  Defining
    <CODE>ALLOC_USE_MALLOC</CODE> will cause the alloc code to use
    <CODE>malloc()</CODE> and <CODE>free()</CODE> for each object.  This
    is far more expensive and should only be used for testing with tools
    such as Electric Fence and Purify.  See <CODE>main/alloc.c</CODE>
    for more details.

    <LI><STRONG><CODE>ap_cpystrn</CODE></STRONG><BR>
    The new <CODE>strncpy</CODE> "lookalike", with slightly different
    semantics is much faster than <CODE>strncpy</CODE> because it
    doesn't have to zero-fill the entire buffer.

    <LI><STRONG><CODE>table_addn</CODE>, <CODE>table_setn</CODE>,
    <CODE>table_mergen</CODE></STRONG><BR>
    These new functions do <STRONG>not</STRONG> call <CODE>pstrdup</CODE>
    on their arguments.  This provides for big speedups.  There is
    also some debugging support to ensure code uses them properly.
    See <CODE>src/CHANGES</CODE> for more information.

    <LI><STRONG><CODE>construct_url</CODE></STRONG><BR>
    The function prototype for this changed from taking a
    <CODE>server_rec *</CODE> to taking a <CODE>request_rec *</CODE>.

    <LI><STRONG><CODE>get_server_name</CODE>, <CODE>get_server_port</CODE></STRONG><BR>
    These are wrappers which deal with the
    <A HREF="mod/core.html#usecanonicalname">UseCanonicalName</A> directive
    when retrieving the server name and port for a request.

    </UL>

 <LI><STRONG>Year-2000 Improvements</STRONG>
  <BR>
  The default <SAMP>timefmt</SAMP> string used by
  <A
   HREF="mod/mod_include.html"
  ><SAMP>mod_include</SAMP></A>
  has been modified to display the year using four digits rather than the
  two-digit format used previously.  The
  <A
   HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html"
  ><SAMP>mod_autoindex</SAMP></A>
  module has also been modified to display years using four digits in
  FancyIndexed directory listings.
 </LI>

 <LI><STRONG><SAMP>ap_*()</SAMP> Routines Moving to a Separate Library</STRONG>
  <BR>
  There are a number of functions and routines that have been developed
  for the Apache project that supplement or supersede library routines
  that differ from one operating system to another.  While most of these
  are used only by the Apache server itself, some are referenced by
  supporting applications (such as <SAMP>htdigest</SAMP>), and these
  other applications would fail to build because the routines were built
  only into the server.  These routines are now being migrated to a
  separate subdirectory and library so they can be used by other
  applications than just the server.
 </LI>

 <LI><STRONG>New <SAMP><A HREF="mod/core.html#serversignature">ServerSignature</A></SAMP> directive</STRONG>
  <BR>
  This directive optionally adds a line containing the server version and
  virtual host name to server-generated pages (error documents, ftp
  directory listings, mod_info output etc.). This makes it easier for users
  to tell which server produced the error message, especially in a proxy
  chain (often found in intranet environments).

 <LI><STRONG>New <SAMP><A HREF="mod/core.html#usecanonicalname">UseCanonicalName</A></SAMP> directive</STRONG>
  <BR>
  This directive gives control over how Apache creates self-referential URLs.
  Previously Apache would always use the <A HREF="mod/core.html#servername">
  ServerName</A> and <A HREF="mod/core.html#port">Port</A> directives to
  construct a "canonical" name for the server.  With <SAMP>UseCanonicalName
  off</SAMP> Apache will use the hostname and port supplied by the client,
  if available.
 </LI>

 <LI><STRONG>New <SAMP><A HREF="mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypassreverse">ProxyPassReverse</A></SAMP> directive</STRONG>
  <BR>
  This directive was added in addition to the <SAMP>ProxyPass</SAMP>
  directive. It lets Apache adjust the URL in the <TT>Location</TT> header on
  HTTP redirect responses. For instance this is essential when Apache is used
  as a reverse proxy to avoid by-passing the reverse proxy because of HTTP
  redirects on the backend servers which stay behind the reverse proxy.
 </LI>

 <LI><STRONG>New map types for
  <A HREF="mod/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteMap"><SAMP>RewriteMap</SAMP></A>
  directive</STRONG>
  <BR>
  The new map types `Randomized Plain Text' and `Internal Function' were added
  to the <SAMP>RewriteMap</SAMP> directive of mod_rewrite.  They provide two
  new features: First, you now can randomly choose a sub-value from a value
  which was looked-up in a rewriting map (which is useful when choosing
  between backend servers in a Reverse Proxy situation). Second, you now can
  translate URL parts to fixed (upper or lower) case (which is useful when
  doing mass virtual hosting by the help of mod_rewrite).
 </LI>
 <LI><STRONG><SAMP>SERVER_VERSION</SAMP> definition abstracted, and
  server build date added</STRONG>
  <BR>
  In earlier versions, the Apache server version was available to modules
  through the <SAMP>#define</SAMP>d value for <SAMP>SERVER_VERSION</SAMP>.
  In order to keep this value consistent when modules and the core server
  are compiled at different times, this information is now available
  through the core API routine
  <CODE>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*apapi_get_server_version()</CODE>.  The use of
  the <SAMP>SERVER_VERSION</SAMP> symbol is deprecated and anti-recommended.
  In addition, a related datum is now available through the use of the
  API routine <CODE>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*apapi_get_server_built()</CODE>,
  which returns a string representing the time the core server was linked.
