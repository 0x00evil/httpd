<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">Upgrading to 1.3 from 1.2</H1>

<P>In order to assist folks upgrading we are now going to maintain a
document describing information critical to existing Apache users.  Note
that it only lists differences between recent major releases, so
for example, folks using Apache 1.1 or earlier will have to figure out
what changed up to Apache 1.2 before this document can be considered
relevant.  Old users could look at the <CODE>src/CHANGES</CODE> file
which tracks code changes.

<P>These are intended to be brief notes, and you should be able to find
more information in either the <A HREF="new_features_1_3.html">New Features</A>
document, or in the <CODE>src/CHANGES</CODE> file.

<h3>Compile-Time Configuration Changes</h3>

<UL>
  <LI>The source code has been <A HREF="sourcereorg.html">reorganized</A>,
    which affects anyone with custom modules or modifications.  But also,
    the <CODE>Module</CODE> directive has been changed to the
    <CODE>AddModule</CODE> directive.

  <LI>The <CODE>Configuration</CODE> variable <CODE>EXTRA_LFLAGS</CODE> has
    been renamed <CODE>EXTRA_LDFLAGS</CODE>.
  
  <LI>The <CODE>-DMAXIMUM_DNS</CODE> definition has been obsoleted by
    changes to <CODE>mod_access</CODE> enforcing double-reverse DNS lookups
    when necessary.
  
  <LI><CODE>mod_dir</CODE> has been split into two pieces
    <CODE><A HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html">mod_autoindex</A></CODE>, and
    <CODE><A HREF="mod/mod_dir.html">mod_dir</A></CODE>.

  <LI><A HREF="mod/mod_browser.html"><CODE>mod_browser</CODE></A> has been
    replaced by <A HREF="mod/mod_setenvif.html"><CODE>mod_setenvif</CODE></A>.

  <LI>IRIX systems with untrusted users who can write CGIs which execute
    as the same uid as httpd should consider using <CODE>suexec</CODE>,
    or adding <CODE>-DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT</CODE> to
    <CODE>EXTRA_CFLAGS</CODE>.  This is slower, more information is available
    on the <A HREF="misc/perf-tuning.html#serialize">performance tuning
    page</A>.  There is a mild denial of service attack possible with the
    default config, but the default config is an order of magnitude faster.

  <LI><CODE>mod_auth_msql</CODE> has been removed from the distribution.

</UL>

<h3>Run-Time Configuration Changes</h3>

<UL>
  <LI><STRONG><SAMP>AuthName</SAMP> strings may need to be quoted</STRONG>
    in <SAMP>.htaccess</SAMP> or server configuration files.  If you use
    an <SAMP>AuthName</SAMP> directive like this:
    <P>
    <PRE>
     AuthName This and That
    </PRE>
    </P>
    you will need to change it to
    <P>
    <PRE>
     AuthName "This and That"
    </PRE>
    </P>
    This change was made for HTTP/1.1 compliance.
  <LI><STRONG>The default Apache ServerRoot directory changed</STRONG>
    from the NCSA-compatible <SAMP>/usr/local/etc/httpd/</SAMP> to
    <SAMP>/usr/local/apache/</SAMP>. This change covers only the default
    setting (and the documentation); it is of course possible to override it
    using the <EM>-d ServerRoot</EM> and <EM>-f httpd.conf</EM> switches
    when starting apache.

  <LI>Folks using HTTP/1.1-style virtual hosting will need to list the
    ip:port pairs that are supposed to have HTTP/1.1-style virtual hosting
    via the <A HREF="mod/core.html#namevirtualhost"><CODE>
    NameVirtualHost</CODE></A> directive.  Previously this support was
    given implicitly on the "main server address".  Now it has to be
    explicitly listed so as to avoid many problems that users had.
    Please see the <A HREF="vhosts/index.html">Apache Virtual Host
    documentation</A> for further details on configuration.

  <LI>The precedence of virtual hosts has been reversed (applies mainly to
    vhosts using HTTP/1.1 Host: headers, and the
    <A HREF="mod/core.html#serverpath">ServerPath</A> directive).  Now
    the earlier vhosts in the file have precedence over the later vhosts.

  <LI><CODE>HostnameLookups</CODE> defaults to Off.

  <LI>The undocumented
    <A HREF="mod/mod_access.html"><CODE>mod_access</CODE></A>
    syntax "allow user-agents" was removed.  The replacement is the
    more general "allow from env".

  <LI>When using wildcards in pathnames (such as * and ?) they no longer
    match / (slash).  That is, they more closely behave how a UNIX shell
    behaves.  This affects <CODE>&lt;Directory&gt;</CODE> directives,
    for example.

  <LI>If no <CODE>TransferLog</CODE> directive is given then nothing will
    be logged.
    (Previously it would default to <CODE>logs/access_log</CODE>.)

  <LI>Apache now has <A HREF="mod/core.html#loglevel">configurable error
    logging levels</A>, and the default eliminates some messages that
    earlier versions always generated.

  <LI>When booting, Apache will now detach itself from stdin, stdout,
     and stderr.  stderr will not be detached until after the config
     files have been read so you will be able to see initial error
     messages.  After that all errors are logged in the error_log.
     This makes it more convenient to start Apache via rsh, ssh,
     or crontabs.

</UL>

<h3>Misc Changes</h3>

<UL>
  <LI><CODE>ServerType inetd</CODE> has been deprecated.  It still exists,
    but bugs are unlikely to be fixed.

  <LI><CODE>httpd_monitor</CODE> has been deprecated.  The replacement is
    to use <CODE>mod_status</CODE> and make a request to a URL such as
    <CODE>http://myhost/server-status?refresh=10</CODE>.

  <LI>
    Apache now provides an effectively unbuffered connection for
    CGI scripts.  This means that data will be sent to the client
    as soon as the CGI pauses or stops output; previously, Apache would
    buffer the output up to a fixed buffer size before sending, which
    could result in the user viewing an empty page until the CGI finished
    or output a complete buffer.  It is no longer necessary to use an
    "nph-" CGI to get unbuffered output.  Given that most CGIs are written
    in a language that by default does buffering (e.g. perl) this
    shouldn't have a detrimental effect on performance.

    <P>"nph-" CGIs, which formerly provided a direct socket to the client
    without any server post-processing, were not fully compatible with
    HTTP/1.1 or SSL support.  As such they would have had to implement
    the transport details, such as encryption or chunking, in order
    to work properly in certain situations.  Now, the only difference
    between nph and non-nph scripts is "non-parsed headers".

  <LI>
    <CODE>dbmmanage</CODE> has been overhauled.
