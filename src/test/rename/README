This stuff is only temporary. 
It is used for the global symbol renaming in the Apache 1.3 sources.
It replaces identifiers in our C source files according to
the rename.cf file. 

 ====================================================================

The proposed steps for this big change are:

    1. Roy:  - tag PRE_AP_PREFIX_RENAME
             - make rename
             - compile entire server (without the back-compat)
             - check symbols
             - check operation of server
             - compile entire server with the back-compat
             - check symbols
             - check operation of server
             - commit
             - tag POST_AP_PREFIX_RENAME
   
    2. Ralf: - tag PRE_AP_PREFIX_RENAME_CLEANUP
             - manually change exported module structure symbols for
               mod_abc_def.c from def_abc_module to APM_abc_def (where APM_ is
               the prefix in rename.cf) and adjust/simplify src/Configure,
               mod_so.c accordingly etc.
             - completely remove HIDE stuff because that's then obsolete
             - compile entire server (without the back-compat)
             - check symbols
             - check operation of server
             - compile entire server with the back-compat
             - check symbols
             - check operation of server
             - commit
             - tag POST_AP_PREFIX_RENAME_CLEANUP

 ====================================================================

This can be used directly by everyone:
(but finally only by Roy!)
--------------------------------------
rename.pl .......... The source renaming script

These three Needs adjustments to work out-of-the-box:
-----------------------------------------------------
rename.cf.update ... Updates rename.cf according to API_EXPORT tags 
                     in the sources. Needs an ID file in src/ which
                     is generated by "mkid" from GNU id-utils
apapi_compat.h.mk .. Creates apapi_compat.h file from rename.cf
apapi.h.mk ......... Creates apapi.h file from rename.cf and ID file
